* [Web site about python testing frameworks](http://pythontesting.net/start-here/)

* nose and nose2 seem to be abandonware
* pytest requires an install step.  Might make the test files more succinct.
  Has things we don't need.
* unittest is sort of clunky but is built into the python distribution.
  No install step required.
* Open Tree has [web API testing code that we can steal](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/germinator/tree/master/ws-tests).  The framework is nonstandard but we don't have to use it.
