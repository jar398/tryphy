PSYCHE. 
ORGAN OF 
THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB, 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MAW, 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., May? 1874. [No. I. 
Introductory. 
THE CAMBRIDGE EXTOMOLOGICAL CLUB was formed 
January 9, 1874, by the following persons, who met at Dr. 
Hagen's house, No. 7 Putnanl Street, Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts, namely: Messrs, E. P. Austin, Edm-ard Burgess, G. R. 
Crotch, of Can~bridge, England, George Dimmock, J. H. 
Emerton, Dr, H. A. Hagen, 3Iessrs. Samuel Henshaw, B. P, 
Mann, H. K. Morrison, J. C. Munro, of Lexington; Dr. A. S. 
Packard, of Salem, Messrs. Eugene Schwarz, and S. H. Scud- 
der. It has since adcled to its number Messrs. J. ,A. Allen, 
Walter F'axon, A. W. Gould, Prof. C. E. Hamh, Messrs. 
Hohes Hinkley, H, G. Hubbard, Baron C. R. Osten Sacken, 
Messrs. F, G. anb born, G. D. Smith, P. S. Sprague, Roland 
Thaxter, of Newtondle, and C. P. Whitney, of Milford, N. H. 
At the fourth monthly meeting, held April 10,1874, the 
Club decided to undertake the publication of a monthly 
organ, to be called PSYCH^. This organ will contain such 
parts of the proceedings of the Club as seem to be of general 
interest, biological contributions upon Arthropods from any 
competent person, lists of captures, with time and locality, 
miscellmeous entomological information, and especially a 
BIBLI~RAPHICAL RECORD, in which last a list will be given 
of all writings upon Entomology published in Korth America, 
and of all foreign writings upon North American Entomology, 
from the beginning of the year 1874, with a brief note of the 
contents of each. For the greater perfection of this list, 
authors and societies are requested to forward their works to 
the editor at the ea~liest date possible. 
Each number will contain at least four pages, and as soon 
as the returns we sufficient to make it possible, a greater 
number of pages will be given. The subscription price in

English Names for Butterflies. 
THE natural objects which attract most attention among 
all classes are birds, butterflies? and flowers. 
In England, 
the native species of all these groups have received common 
English names; and no doubt many persons have thus ac- 
quired a good knowledge of Natural History who might have 
been repelled by scientific Greek or Lat,in con~pounds. 
In 
our own country all the common birds and flowers have also 
received such names, and it is my belief that the st,udy of 
butterflies would be far more popular, if they also had com- 
mon names. 
There would be an advantage, too, in this, for 
Antiopa would be t.he Camberwell Beauty all the same, how- 
ever fiercely men wrangled over Papilio vs;.Vanessa as its 
proper adjunct ! 
In PSYCHE, then, as its appropriate place, we print the fol- 
lowing list of names proposed for New &gland butterflies, 
using as a basis on the- scientific side? the names of rny,Revi- 
sion. Account is taken of all names that have been proposed 
by Gosse and others, and they are retained unless special rea- 
sons prevent.

2. @neb Juttu.- The arctic Satyr. 
3. Enodia Portlandia.- The Pearly-eye.

4. Hinois AZope.- The blue-eyed Grayling.

Ringlet In English parlance.

Collecting in the White Mountains. 
Year after year, entomologists seek the summits of the 
White Mountains of New Hampshire in search of rare insects, 
and the number now known from that region is so great that 
catalogues have already become necessary. Very few persons, 
however, have attempted to separate collections obtained 011 
the extreme heights from those obtained on the lower plateaus 
of the barren region, or at the heads of ravines; yet t'here 
are two well defined districts above the forest limits, and 
although most insects found above the trees are common to 
both regions, specimens of one should not be mingled with 
those of the other. 
With a view of inducing those who visit the mountains 
this summer to help in the formation of distinctive alpine and 
subalpine lists, we offer (by the kind permission of Professor 
Charles H. Hitchcock of the New Hampshire Geological 
Survey) the accompanying map of the White Mountains, in 
which the alpine district is colored red and the subalpine blue. 
The subalpine district is the region of the dwarfed spruce, 
and includes the heads of the deepest ravines ; the alpine is 
characterized by naked, broken masses of rock, excepting on 
the level spots, where sedges conceal them. (Eneis semideu 
is confined to this highest district,

- 
Vernacular Names for Butterflies. 
IT may be that' in England the native species of all classes 
of birds, butterflies, and flowers (and, I trust, of fishes like- 
wise) have received tommon English names. 
My experience is that in continental countries of Europe a 
great many species, such as come under most frequent obser- 
vation of the public, have their common names and often 
three or four different names at a time, each according to 
provincialisms. A popular name of a fish is of acknowledged 
utility in a market, and could not be very well supplanted by 
a scientific one, yet without their scientific names being as- 
certained, there would be little comparison possible between 
markets West and East and those of Europe. The popular 
name under which a plant or butterfly is known cannot but 
have a charm even for a scientific searcher, and ought to be 
remembered by him and promulgated in print. But his task 
is to popularize science by utilizing such names, and by them 
to lead amateurs to awaken to the advantages of scientific 
nomenclature as one that is not provincial, nor exclusively 
English, but cosmological. 
Amateurs cannot possibly take much interest until they 
begin to bring things into groups by their own observations 
of similarities, and later with scientific assistance into genera. 
I want to have genuine popular names (be they ever so 
local, as "Camberwell Beauty" for a butterfly that ranges all 
over Europe and over America to California) distinguished 
from names that are created more or less arbitrarily, or by 
merely translating scientific double names into the vernacular. 
The adoption and promulgation of these latter ones seems to 
me of very doubtful policy, as they do not harmonize with 
the originally popular names and may create, in an amateur's

mind, a greater difficulty of grouping the specimens. A 
White Mountain butterfly (par excellence), a dull-eyed and 
a blue-eyed Grayling, an arctic Satyr, &c., &c., and Camber- 
well Beauty would lead soon to misunderstandings which 
could not be disentangled. 
With reference to the latter, I ask, who here would willing- 
ly adopt such a name for the Antiopa of California? ! Every 
person from Germany greets it here as b6Trauermantel" 
(mourning cloak), and may ask, perhaps, how is it called in 
English ? Could I answer? So with bbAtalanta." The - 
same as at home. our "Admiral??" How shall I name for 
them our five Papiliones, whom they all know as "Swallow- 
tails ?'Pliilenor I name for them the green Swallow-tail. 
Finally, let us remember and always print the "popular" 
names, as a by-gift, but let us abstain from trying to create 
popular names, if it were even by translating the whole of 
Kirby's Catalogue into the vernacular. 
To show that I myself am a lover of popular names, to 
which I always lend an attentive ear, I make free to add 
these following genuine ones, and to ask permission to report 
more from time to time, when memory serves me : 
British Blondes, for the two Coenonymphas ; 
Buckeye, for Junonia Cosnia.

9. Dcriicms Plexippus.- The Monarch. 
D'Urban calls it the Storm Fritillary, but it is not a Fritillary. 
Gosse 
called it the Archippus, but tiis is not its proper name. It is one of the 
largest of our butterflies, and rules a vast domain. 
10. Basilarchia Disippe. - The Viceroy. 
This name is suggested from its mimicry of the preceding species. 
11. Baailarchia Astyanax.- he red-spotted Purple. 
This name was proposed by Gosse. 
12. Basilarchia Arthemis.- The banded Purple. 
Also proposed by Gosse. 
13. Boxocopa Herse.- The tawny Emperor. 
The species of this group are termed- Emperors in England. 
14. Polygonkt interrogationis.- The Violet-tip. 
A name well proposed by Gosse.

9. Dcii?aus Rexippus.- The Monarch. 
D'Urban calls it the Storm Fritillary, but it is not a Fritillary. 
Gosse 
called it the Archippus, but this is not its proper name. It is one of the 
largest of our butterflies, and rules a vast domain. 
10. Basilarchia Disippe.- The Viceroy. 
This name is suggested from its mimicry of the preceding species. 
11. Basilarchin Astyanax.- The red-spotted Purple. 
This name was proposed by Gosse. 
12. Basilarchia Arthemis.- The banded Purple. 
Also proposed by Gosse. 
13. Doxocopa Heme.-The tawny Emperor. 
The species of this group are termed-amp erors in England 
14. Polygonia interrogationis.- The Violet-tip. 
A name well proposed by Goshe.

ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT. 
Mr. B. P. Mann has recently received from 
Florida a caterpillar of "Papilio Cresphontes," in which the front pair of 
prolegs is'greatly aborted. The under surface of the third abdominal 
segment bears a pair of slight mamrniform elevations, each with a sessile 
crescent of booklets ;these can scarcely ever be brought into use, yet they 
are as well developed as usual, and the markings on the side of the 
prolegs show that no part is actually wanting, only all the fleshy parts are 
excessively short. The caterpillar is apparently in the final stage, but 
unfortunately arrived in a dying condition.

GICAL 
ORGAN OF THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOi 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
CLUB. 
- 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., August, 1874. [No. 4. 
Early springButterflies at the White Mountains. 
DURING four sunny days (June 2 - 5) spent in the Glen this 
spring, in a search for butterflies, the following species were 
noticed. 
The wild cherries were just blossoming. 
Basilarchia Disippe. 
Two or three larvae were seen on 
poplar, of just the same size as others of the next species near 
them. 
Basilarchia A~themis. The caterpillars were found not un- 
common upon the black birch ; one upon poplar, on the same 
twig with Disippe. 
All had left their hibernacula, which pre- 
cisely resemble those of the preceding species, and had moulted 
at least once ; the first moult almost invariably takes place on 
their emerging from winter quarters, as proved by the pelliele 
left upon the tip of the leaf forming the hibernaculum. A& 
search for the caterpillar was the principal object of my visit, I 
must have examined nearly five thousand plants of black birch ; 
the result proves that the eggs are laid almost exclusively upon 
horizontally extended branches of small plants not more than 
two or three feet high, skirting the road-side, so that the cater- 
pillars must almost invariably be buried in snow the winter 
through. 
The caterpillars are generally lighter colored than 
those of the preceding species. but resemble them wonderfully. 
The first caterpillar changed to chrysalis the night of June 7th, 
and emerged the morning of the 18th. 
Polygonia Faunus. The butterfly was very abundant, the 
males far exceeding the female 
in number; the latter were 
apparently not yet prepared to deposit their eggs. 
Polygonia grc~cilis. 
This butterfly was rather common, and 
what is strange, many more females than males were taken ; 
they could not be induced to lay eggs under muslin during my 
Psirhe 1 Oil-Wpre.1903). hfp //psyche aitclub org/1/1.0013 htd 




================================================================================


short visit, and died just after the journey home. One left be- 
hind in a muslin bag, on willow, was found a week afterward, 
by Mr. Whitney, to have died without depositing. 
Polygonia Progne. A single female was taken ; it has never 
before been found in this region. 
Nymphalis J-albwn. One or two specimens only were seen 
on the 4th, apparently just out of winter quarters ; they appear 
later, I believe, than other hibernating Prefect!, and these 
were seen on the sunny side of a barn, which had probably 
served as their winter refuge. 
Papilio Antiopa. 
Half a dozen specimens were seen. 
Aglais Milberti. A single female was taken. 
8. If. Scudder. 
ENTOMOLOGICAL EXCURSION TO WAVERLEY. - On the 7th of May 
the members of the Club, to the number of half a dozen, made an excur. 
sion to the vicinity of Waverley. The day proved unfavorable, as there 
was a raw wind which kept the insects out of sight, and very little was 
accomplished. 
Of Coleoptera very few specimens were taken, and those of common spe- 
cies, the most noteworthy being a specimen of Badister notatus, a species 
which is rare in this vicinity, and Diccelus elongatus, common about Waver- 
ley, though rare elsewhere in the vicinity of Boston. 
Of Lepidoptera Mr. Morrison obtained a perfect specimen of Anticlea 
rasiliata Guen., a species not common in this vicinity. 
Caterpillars of Basilarchia Disippe were obtained on three species of wil- 
lows, either eating the catkins for want of leaves, or still concealed in their 
hibernacula. The observations of the party showed that they hibernate 
both In the second and third stages, and that each makes a winter abode of 
just the size of its body, into which it crawls head foren~ost, and which it 
must vacate in the spring by a retreating movement. The caterpillar 
moults very soon after re-appearing, and one was found nearly half grown 
upon a twig still bearing only catkins. JS. P. Austin. 
VERNACULAR NAMES FOR BUTTERFLIES. - EDITOR PSYCHE : I very 
much approve of Mr. Scudder's list of vernacular names for our butterflies. 
Permit me to stand sponsor in your columns for the following : 
Calephelis borealis. - The large Metal-mark. 
Calephelis pumila. - The small Metal-mark. 
Feniseca Tarquinius. - The Wanderer. Aug. 3. Grote.

ON THE OCCURRENCE OF COCHINEAL IN THE "NORTHERN UNITED 
STATES. - In the northwestern part of Nebraska and the adjacent part of 
Dakota, are large areas thickly covered with several spgies of Cactaceae, 
on which I was surprised to find Cochineal in considerable quantities. As 
red paint is a favorite article of use among the Indians, I inquired of sev- 
eral men who were familiar with the Indians of the plains, bot)h Sioux and 
Pawnees, if the Indians mack! use of the cochineal, but none of them had 
ever seen or heard of its use. 
At that time the fact of the occurrence of this insect in such high lati- 
tudes was quite new to me, nor have I since seen any statement in print of 
its occurrence in the United States, except in southern California, though 
I have learned from collectors that it is not uncommon in Kansas and 
southwards. I have therefore tho~~glit a brief notice of the fact might be 
acceptable. 
The occurrence of this insect in such a region suggests a possible indus- 
try at some future time, .when the Great West shall be settled up, as in this 
region very little cm be cultivated, and if cochineal can be produced it 
may be worth trying. 
E . P. Austin.

English Names for Butterflies. 
(Continued frompage 11.) 
19. Papilio Adopa.- The Camberwell Beauty. 
The well known English name, worth importing, although local, and hav- 
ing a special significance for England only. It has also been called the 
Mourning Cloak, an expressive name, but translated from the German. 
20. Aglais Mi1berti.- The nettle Tortoise-shell. 
Called Milbert's butterfly by Harris, and the forked butterfly by Gosse, 
the last in allusion to the name given by Say. 
The caterpillar feeds, as is 
. well known, on nettle. 
21. Vanessa Atalanta- The red Admiral. 
The English name. 
22. Vanessa Huntem- The painted Beauty. 
A name well proposed by Gosse, indicating its relation to the next spe- 
cies. 
Harris simply called it Hunter's butterfly. 
23. Vanessa cardui- The painted Lady. 
The English name for this cosmopolitan butterfly. 
Harris called it the 
thistle butterfly. 
24. Junonia Coenia.- The Buckeye. 
Mr. Behrens says this is an English name for this insect. 
I have never 
heard of it, and give it only on his testimony.

A North Greenland Butterfly. 
The recent polar expedition of Captain Hall, in the U. S. 
Steamer Polaris, bought home from Polaris Bay, Lat. 81' 38' 
N., two specimens, male and female, of BrentMs polaris (Boisd.) 
- the most northern butterfly known. 
The male is badly rubbed, but evidently differs, as the fresher 
female does, from Labrador specimens, in being of a much duller 
- 
color upon both surfaces of the wings. 
The upper surface of 
the male, in Labrador specimens, is bright orange fulvous, that 
of the females a little duller; while in these Greenland exam- 
ples the color is a dull sordid fulvous, almost changing to ashen 
in the fore-wings of the female. The dark markings of the upper 
surface in both sexes are not so dark in the Greenland as in the 
Labrador specimens, and, with some exceptions, they are also 
slightly narrower ; the transverse markings in the cell of the fore 
wings in both sexes are noticeably slenderer, but the mesial band 
of the fore wings, besides being less irregularly zigzag, is broad- 
ened in the posterior half of the wing, at least in the female, and 
its border more obscured by scattered griseous scales ; the mesial 
- 
band of the hind wing is, however, narrower than in Labrador 
specimens, and there is therefore a greater extent of fulvous 
surface, but that is greatly obscured by griseous scales; the 
roundish spots of the extra-mesial row are rather larger than 
usual in the female. 
Beneath, similar differences occur. 
The general color is 
duller than on the upper surface, though not to so great an ex- 
tent, and the contrasts of the dark and bright markings are not 
so noticeable as in Labrador specimens. On the fore wings, the 
lower portion of the mesial band is broader, as on the upper 
surface, and the extra-mesial spots are also larger, especially

ORGAN OF THE CAMBRIDGE ENTO~OLOGICAL CLUB 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., July, 1875. [No. 15. 
- 
The Introduction of Danaida Plexippus into the 
Pacific Islands. 
[In a letter from Dr. Luther H. Giilick; with additional comments.] + 
Û÷b 1852, I returned, after eleven years' absence, to the 
Sandwich Islands, and my brother John drew my attention to 
the fact that the so-called American milk-weed (Asclepias) 
had, during my absence, been introduced, and had spread so 
rapidly as to be already ranked, in that tropic climate, with 
troublesome weeds. My brother had, early after its introduc- 
tion, notired that in whatever part-of the groupthe milk-weed 
appeared, there also what he called the milk-weed butterfly 
(Danaus) appeared ; a butterfly unknown on all the Sandwich 
Islands till after the introduction of the milk-weed. 
bb 111 1857, a number of choice plants were sent me at Pon- 
ape or Ascension Island of the Caroline Range, from Honolulu, 
by our small missionary brig of about one hundred tons bur- 
then, whose diminutive hold and cabin were several times ran- 
sacked in every corner before it reached our island, so that no 
such butterfly as the Danaus could easily have been concealed 
there. The plants were in glass-covered cases, as closely sealed 
from the air as it was possible to make them. The vessel sailed 
from Honolulu on the 24th of June, and reached Ponapc, two 
thousand miles or more from the Sandwich Islands, on the 18th 
of August, or after fifty-four days, several days after which the 
case was for the first time opened, thus making a period of about 
eight weeks from the time of its closure. On the voyage to 
Ponape, the vessel touched at Apaiang of the Gilbert Islands 
and Ebon of the Marshall Islands, both low coral atolls, where 
butterflies of any Idnd are all but unknown, and at Kusaie or 




================================================================================


Strong's Island, which is of basaltic formation and clothed with 
the most beautiful luxuriance of the tropics, but where, in a 
general way, I know that neither the above-mentioned milk- 
weed nor its accompanying butterfly were at that time to be 
found. 
"Some weeks after the plants had been opened on Ponape 
(I should think it must have been three or four months) there 
having meantime been no vessel from any other land, we discov- 
ered .several young plants of the milk-weedyspringing up in the 
earth in which various other plants had been brought from the 
Sandwich ~slands. These rnilk-weeds had evidently sprung 
from seeds in the Sandwich Island earth, as we found no plants 
of that kind after a most careful inspection of every item, when 
the case first arrived from Honolulu, and as they were plants 
till then unknown On Ponape, my brother Theodore and I set 
ourselves to watching whether or not the butterfly would ap- 
pear with it. The plants did not grow very rapidly or healthily, 
but just as several of them were beginning to develop flower 
buds, we discovered a swarm of small caterpillars of the Da- 
naus, of different sizes, but none of them apparently more 
than two or three days out of the egg, feeding on the leaves. 
This, of course, stimulated our curiosity exceedingly. We had 
to de'stroy a con4d~ra.ble portim. of the svarrn, PO is to 1:pcvre 
for the remainder nourishment sufficient from the five or six 
slender nncl stunted plants to permit of then* maturing, for we 
found that the caterpillars would feed on nothing else. In due 
time the chrysalids were formed. We took charge of them, 
showed them to the natives, and offered large rewards to any 
one who would bring us others of the same !;i~:cl, b2t thy did 
not and said they could not, for they were unknown on the 
island. In about two weeks the butterflies appeared, and we 
like rewards, with like results, regarding them, and as 
Ponape has but very few butterflies of any hind, we were sure 
they were something new. 
'6 We afterwards took a few of the seeds of the milk-weed, 
- 
carefully cleaned, to the opposite side of the island, twenty-five 
miles as we travelled round the shore, and there planted them. 
The plants, apparently now naturalized, grew very thriftily to 




================================================================================


the height of four or five-feet, and after some months the but- 
terfly appeared there also (it was the butterfly, I think, that 
was first noticed by my friends) and that too, before they had 
become common on the northeastern aide of the island, where 
they were first propagated, and long before they were found at 
any intermediate point. I am under the impression that the 
plant was subsequently introduced at Kusaie, and that the but- 
terfly also appeared there, but of this I am not personally cog- 
nizant. 
" Barceiffna, Spain, Ayri117,1873tt 
The above account was furnished by Rev. Dr. Gulick, at my 
request, for insertion in my work on New England Butterflies; 
but its special interest induces me to publish it independently. 
The butterfly in question is a species which abounds over the 
southern half of N. America and the northern half of S. 
America, including the intervening islands. In N, America, it . 
is single-brooded (not double-brooded, as asserted by Mr. Riley), 
the butterfly hibernating. It leaves its winter quarters later in 
the season than other hibernating butterflies and continues 
upon the wing until July and August, laying eggs all the time, 
so that the insect may be found in- its earlier stages throughout 
most of the summer. The eggs are deposited upon the under 
surface of leaves and hatch in four or five days; the caterpillar 
attains its fall growth in two or three weeks and the chrysalis 
hangs from nine to fifteen days. The earliest butterflies which 
have not hibernated may be found in New England in July; so 
that while the earlier stages we passed rapidly, the perfect 
insect lives a full year, mingling on the wing with its own prog- 
eny and witnessing the decay and renewed growth of the plant 
which nourished it; for the Asclepias dies early and is not euffi- 
&ntly grown to support the caterpillars of Danaida when the 
first butterflies appear in the spring. 
The butterfly has extraordinary powers of flight and has been 
seen fifteen or twenty miles from land ; when several are sport- 
ing together they are described as " gyrating in a wild manner 
at all heights, " some so far up that they appear 46 but as moving 
specks in the sky. " But it would be utterly absurd to presume 




================================================================================


that this butterfly could have traversed two thousand miles of 
ocean, and in addition have appeared on a11 island less than 
twenty miles in diameter almost simultaneously with a few 
plants of Asclepias, accidentally introduced ! The only other 
alternative is to suppose that it was carried to the island with 
the box of plants sent to Dr. Gulick. But the precise manner 
of its introduction is still a perplexing question. In a vast ma- 
jority of cases the accidental transportation of insects from one 
country to another is during their preparatory stages ; but in 
this case the voyage is known to have taken nearly eight weeks, 
while the transformations of the Danaida, even in a temperate 
country, seldom occupy more than four or five weeks, and in 
the tropics doubtless take less time. So that, should a plant 
of the Asclepias weed, bearing eggs of the Danaida just laid, 
have been accidentally introduced into the Wardian case sent 
to Dr. Gulick, the butterflies would certainly have appeared in 
the closed case before the voyage was half over ; and we must 
suppose that the caterpillars from which they were produced 
had eaten up every trace of Asclepias, that the butterflies 
themselves remained therein unseen for a month, and that at 
least a pair of them made their escape unnoticed from the ease 
on its arrival at Ponape. 
* 
This seems quite impossible. 
And although Dr. Gulick dis- 
tinctly says that the " diminutive hold and cabin " of the vessel 
"were several times in every corner before it readied 
our island, so tliat no such butterfly as the Danaus could 
easily have been concealed there," this seems to be the only 
other alternative, and one which the long duration of this 
stage of the insect and its power of extended hibernation 
directly favor. In this case we must suppose that a pregnant 
female flew into the hold (to rest for the night) while the ves- 
. 
el was loading at Honolulu and, undergoing a forced imprison- 
ment (or pseudo - hibernation) during the voyage, escaped on 
unlading and in course of time found Asclepias ready for its 
necessities. A single butterfly, even of the great size of Dan- 
aida Plexippns would easily escape observation flying at large 
about a wooded tropical island. Samuel H. Scudder.

On the Insect Fauna of the White Mountains. 
Mr. Grote, in an article Lb On the Insect Fauna of the White 
Mo~mtains," in PSYCHE for last month, writes as follows: L6 On 
comparing it (Agrotis scropulana, Morr.) with three speci- 
mens of Pachnobia carnea, Thunb., from Labrador, it seems to 
me probable that a larger series may show that the species are 
the same," and " I have a single specimen (of Agrotis opipara, 
Morr.) from the White Mountains, of which my determination 
is not absolute, but I believe it to be the species, since it came 
from Mr. Morrison, though unnamed. If so, I think we have 
to do with A. islandica." 
In making synonymical corrections, we want certainties, not 
probabilities, and it is '' obviously unsafe " to make or to insin- 
uate such corrections on the scanty and doubtfully determined 
material, which Mr. Grote states he possesses. I will mention 
that the four species named are entirely distinct from each 
other ; and that, in working on my paper on the genus Agrotis, 
my material of them consisted of thirty Pachnobia carnea, from 
Labrador, and one from the White Mountains, bred by myself; 
six specimens each of Agrotis scropulana and opipara, all bred 
from the larvae ; and three specimens of Agrotis islandica, lent 
me by Dr. Packard. 
In Pachnobia carnea there is no basal black dash, and the 
reniform spot is obsolete ; in Agrotis scropdana the basal 
dash is very large, black and distinct, and the claviform spot is 
long, clear ell ow and conspicuous ; in the former the interior 
line is oblique and outwardly undulate, in the latter it is very 
strongly drawn in, sometimes touching the basal dash. Agrotis 
islandica and opipara do not bear any resemblance to each 
other; the gound color is entirely different; the former is a 
dull gray inconspicuous species, with fine and interrupted mark- 
ings, the latter is entirely cinereous, with distinct heavy black 
markings. I do not think it necessary to give other points of 
difference, as those pointed out above are amply sufficient to 
separate the insects. 
B. K Morrison.

================================================================================


1 went'with Dr. Waters to Pleasant Street in Newton, on the 
grounds of Mr. Davis, of the firm of Hallett & Davis, piano- 
forte makers, near the Cochituate Aqnednct, where we found 
thii-four more, one of which was black. We did not get upon 
the ground till 9 o'clock, P. M,, or later, when it was quite dark 
and moonless. The larvae seemed to be stHI emerging from the 
punif, as after taking all I could find at one time in a place I 
afterwards found more there. These larvse shine with a bright 
light from their spiracles and the membrane between the rings, 
which discovers them at a distance of some mds. 
T found them 
mostly near the rocrts of the grass, under or near an evergreen 
hedge and also a " hck-thorn " hedge, hut some at_a consider; 
able distance from the hedge, in m owhard. Dr- Water8 found 
some nnder pine tree3 cm a k h knoII near by. The whole 
locality vas rather high and dry, no dew being on the ground, 
nor had there been a dew for several 'weeks. 
KO larvse were 
found near the brook which nms by the orchard, 
On the evening of the 28th of July we went with two friends 
to the same locality in Newton where we had found the tinrtp - 
four larva 
There, and on the lane entering Homer Street 
opposite Mr. E. F. Waters', and on the side of Centre Street, 
we found twenty more la-, fgur of which were quite Mack ; 
the others yellow. All were on the average smaller than those 
black ones nearly of the same size with each 
f July, I obtained permission to 
examine the grounds of Mr. J. R, Lowell, near Mt. Auburn, 
in Cambridge. There, mder or near pine trees, I cauglit thirty 
more larvse, fourteen of winch were black; the rest yellow. 
On the evening of the 6th of Auga'it I honted long and dili- 
gently for more of. these larvae in Mr. Lew+eII's grounds, but 
found none. 
z 
Thus in one month we found eighty yellow and nineteen 
black luminous Coleopterous larvae. Some ofthege'afterwards 
escaped, some I preserved in alcohol, some died of unknown 
causes, but on the 2d of August I had forty-eight living yellow 
ones and eighteen living black ones in my jar's of earth. The 
last of thwe died in Novemb f them haying pupated. 




================================================================================


Since the occurrences narrated above, I have made many 
inquiries about similar larvae, and, have only learned that Mr. 
Sanborn found three or four larvae apparentlyidentical with one 
of the above, by the roadside between West Roxbury and Ded- 
ham. The first he had seen were brought him in 1862, by E. 
- 
S. Rand, Jr., who found them in Dedham. 
The most abundant form of these larvae differs so little from 
the third species " of unknown larvas described by Osten- 
Sacken in vol. i of the Proceedings of the Entomological Soci- 
ety of Philadelphia, p. 129, that I think it sufficient only to 
describe the differences. 
* 
This is No. 3074 of my collection. 
It is 85 mm. long, elon- 
gated, with the first five rings behind the small head success- 
ively widening, the last three rings almost insensibly narrowing, 
the last ring evenly rounded ; of a soft-leathery consistence. 
Lateral margins of alt the abdominal segments and sometimes of 
the thoracic ones, the whole venter, and sometimes alao the 
front and hind margins of the thoracic segments yellowish. 
Head retractile, well exserted when in walking, transverse, 
dilated rnedially behind, dark brown or almost black, sometimes 
paler on the margins. Anterior margin of the head above 
between the bases of the mandibles bisinaated, the forward 
projections of the curve being lateral, and the hollow central 
and broader. Below, directly over the mouth, the margin is 
truncate, centrally notched. No separate clypeus or labrum 
distinguishable. Third joint of antennae cylindrical, twice as 
long as broad, one-third aa long as the second joint, with no 
trace of a fourth joint in most casea. Ma11dIbles strongly 
curved, either one outermost. So-called Lb second appendage " 
of the maxilla? indistinguishable. Third and fourth joints of 
maxillary palpi usually at least as long as they are broad. 
Prothorax, when ex tended, as broad, anteriorly as the head, 
longitudinal, posteriorly twice as broad as the head. Mesotho- 
rax and metathorax nearly equal in length, the latter a little 
longer ; each shorter than prothorax. Punctuation of die tho- 
rax dmost none. Tips of cox= not very approximate, the po5 
terior ones less &qmximate. Hind legs not much larger than 
the others and having abo'nt the same proportions. All the 




================================================================================


legs spiny and * bristly, but with no complete rings of spines, 
Abdominal segments not very different in length, but their 
relative lengths not very definite. Pseudopod a flattened trun- 
cated cone, of homogeneous fleshy texture ; exsertile tip bitu- 
berculate or bifurcate. 
No. 3075 of my collection, one specimen, is the dead larva 
given me by Dr. Waters, July 9. Dr. Waters assured me 
that all the larvae in this lot were luminous, and as they were 
collected in the evening, they must have been so, yet this larva 
has a broader head actually and proportionally, short stout 
mandibles dilated and bent at a right angle in the middle, max- 
illary palpi not tapering, short and stout, rounded at the end, 
the third and fourth joints forming a mass of oval outline three 
times as long as either the first or second ; the labial palpi short 
and stout, approximate; and other differences which I will not 
dwell upon with my present material. 
The black larvae make a third form, of which I find no speci- 
mens preserved in my collection, and did not take a particular 
description. They differ markedly in being able or apt to 
extinguish their light at times, which none of the yellow larvse 
did, and then to resume it. They are- much more active than 
the others, and smaller. I 
What else I have to say refers to the first larvas described. 
They are quite active, and I should judge from the structure of 
their jaws that they are carnivorous. 
I did not succeed in 
feeding them with meat, earthworms, slugs, larvae, leaves, nor 
slices of potato. They were in the habit of descending below 
the surface of the ground in the daytime, or sometimes remain- 
ing coiled up on the surface. Numbers congregated in the day 
time under a piece of tin or a slice of potato. 
They generally 
formed passages in the earth, with "chambers, in which they 
rested singly. At night they moved about upon the surface. 
I did not determine whether artificial darkness would arouse 
them in the daytime. At night they were attracted to the side 
of the jar nearest artificial light. When disturbed, they roll 
themselves up with the head applied to the ventral surface of 
about the sixth ring, and with the terminal segment reaching 
the back of about the third ring ; the head is then withdrawn 




================================================================================


almost entirely within the prothorax, so that at most the man- 
dibles, tip of mentum and palpi project beyond the prothorax. 
When picked up, they give quite a cold sensation to the touch. 
Sometimes they emit a blackish fluid from the mouth, in the 
manner of locusts. Erroneously, according to the claims of 
priority, although the error is more appropriate than the truth, 
they are commonly called " glow-worms." By the suggestion 
and indications of Mr. E. P. Austin, I conjecture that they 
are the larvae of Asaphes rnmnonius. B. Pickman Mann. 
The Note of the Katydid. 
Since I began to study the character of the notes produced 
by different species of Orthoptera, it has been my fortune to 
hear that of the true Katydid (Cyrtophyllus concavus) but once. 
This insect lives in tree tops, one or two only in a tree, in little 
colonies scattered here and there over most of the United States 
east of the Rocky Mts. One such colony I encountered in the 
heart of the city of Springfield, Mass., and spent an evening en- 
deavoring to reduce the notes to scale. The insects which I 
observed were from fifteen to twenty rods distant, perched in 
the tops of maple, cherry and elm trees, not far above my 
window. 
They ordinarily call " Katy, " or say " she did, " rather than 
u Katy did"; that is, they rasp their fore wings twice, more 
frequently than thrice ; these two notes are of equal (and 
extraordinary) emphasis, the latter about one quarter longer 
' 
than the former ; or, if three notes are given, the first and sec- 
ond are alike and a little shorter than the last; the notes are 
repeated at the rate of two hundred per minute; and while 
the interval between two series of notes varies to a certain 
degree, it is seldom greater than two and one-third seconds, or 
less than a second and a quarter ; usually it is between one and 
seven-eighths and two seconds. The accompanying cut, in which 
each bar represents a second of time, attempts to reduce this to 
a scale.

The note, which sounds like xr, has a most shocking lack of 
melody; the poets who have sung its praises must have heard it 
at the distance that lends enchantment ; in close proximity the 
sound is excessively rasping and grating, louder and harsher 
than I have heard from any other of the Locustarians, the 
noisiest of all Orthoptera. 
Since these creatures are abundant 
wherever they occur, the noise produced by them, on an even - 
ing especially favorable to their song, is most discordant. Usu- 
ally, as I have said, the notes are two in number, rapidly 
repeated, at short intervals ; perhaps nine out of ten individuals 
will ordinarily give this number ; but, occasionally, a stubborn 
insect persists in sounding the triple note ; aLd as Katydids 
appear desirous of answering their neighbors in the same meas- 
- - 
we, the proximity of a treble-voiced songster demoralizes a 
whole neighborhood, and a curious medley results ; notes from 
some individual may then be heard all the while, scarcely a 
moment's time intervening between their stridulations, some 
nearer, others at a greater distance ; so that the air is filled by 
these noisy troubadours with an 
indescribably confused and 
grating clatter. This renders special observation of the notes 
of any individual all the more difficult, and it is only by great 
ptiekce and careful selection that it can be acc&nplished, 
unless one places himself upon the outskirts of a colony.

donewoptera and Neuroptera 11ad bee13 co1lected this year, 
some by himself in &fassachusetts, and some by Mr. Sanborn 
in Kentucky. Amongst these are CaZop~enjx angust$e?znis 
and PetaZwa Fhoreyi. 
The two other species of 
Petalura 
known belong to New Holland. This genus is so exceptional 
that the first specimen of the American species was declared 
by Selys to be of necessity A~~stralian and erroneously labelled. 
Some larvze from the same locality and collector probably 
belong to Petalura. By the dilated aiitem~ they agree, with 
the larva of IZagenius. Two Aeschna fuycillata were caught 
in Manchester, Mass. Onlay one specimen is known to exist in 
Europe. A specimen of Neuronk pctrdalis was also capt~~red. 
The only nearly related species live in Japan, the northern 
part of Europe and ~JI Siberia. They have the pecdiarity to 
fly very higli ; this specimen was taken on top of a stage-coach. 
Dr. Hagen farther obtained a Heinerobid of the genus Dila 
from Kentucky : the male with pectinated antennze, the female 
with a long ovipositor like that of Rhaphidia. Two species are 
known from Enrope and two from Asia, viz : one from Ceylon 
and one from India.

ORGAN OF 
THE CAMBRIDGE ENTOMOLOGICAL CLUB 
EDITED BY B. PICKMAN MANN. 
Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., October, 1875. [No. 18. 
The Chirp of the Mole-cricket. 
The common mole-cricket of the United States (Gryllotalpa 
borealis Burm.) usually commences its daily chirp at about four 
o'clock in the afternoon, but stridulates most actively at about 
dusk. On a cloudy day, however, it may be heard as early as 
two or three o'clock ; this recognition of the weather is rather 
remarkable in a burrowing insect, and the more so since it does 
- 
not appear to come to the surface to stridulate, but remains in 
its burrow usually an inch below the surface of the ground. 
The European mole-cricket is said to chirp both within its bur- 
row and at its mouth (plerumque sul terrd, Fischer says), and 
it may be that our species sometimes seeks the air in chanting; 
but the chirp, as far as I have heard it, always has a uniformly 
subdued tone, as if produced in some hidden recess. Fischer 
says that the European species, which is twice as large as ours, 
cannot be heard more than from one hundred and fifty to two 
hundred feet (ultra spatiurn 20-30 passuum). Ours, when 
certainly beneath the surface, is easily distinguished at a dis- 
tance of five rods; and one would presume that it could be 
heard, if above ground, nearly twice as far away. 
Its chirp is a guttural sort of sound, like grit or pi-&, re- 
peated in a trill indefinitely, but seldom for more than two or 
three minutes, and often for a less time. 
It is pitched at two 
octaves above middle C, and the notes are usually repeated at 
the rate of about 130 or 135 per minute; sometin~es, when 
many are singing, even as rapidly as 150 per minute. Often,

Vol. I.] Cambridge, Mass., March, l87'6. [No. 23. 
List of Coleoptera collected in Michigan in 1874. 
Among a large number of species of Coleoptera collected in 
Michigan by Mr. H. G. Hubbard and myself, during the year 
1874, those mentioned in the following list will be found of 
some interest. Where no locality is given, the species were 
collected in the vicinity of Detroit. 
Omopkron robusturn Horn. 
A single specimen on the shore of Lake Erie 
near Monroe, in September. 
Schizogenius ferruginous Putz. 
With the preceding, not rare. 
Dtcaelus purpuratus Bon. 
The larva of this species is very beautifully 
colorcd, and was found in rotten logs, in the middle of August; it under- 
goes its transformation in this place, and the imago appears about the be- 
ginning of September. 
Bembidium antfuliferum Led1 Very rare under decaying leaves; pre- 
viously found only in California. 
Hydroporus rotundatus Lee. In the Detroit River, rare. 
Helophurus intervulatus Gyllh. 
Not common near Detroit. 
Philhydrus consors Lee. Much rarer than Ph. cinctus Say. 
Cercyon unipunctaium Linn. and C. centrimaculatun St. Not rare, on the 
window of a stable, in October. 
Cercyon naviculare Zimm. Abundant in decaying fungus. 
Ndssidium americanum Mots? In a kind of Polyporus not rare in July. 
Rilium Collani Makl. 
Common in decaying fungus. 
Smicrusjlicornis Fairm. Under decaying hay, in October, not rare. 
Pterp balteata Lee. 
In rotten wood and sphagnum moss, not rare. 
Ptinclla quercus Lee. Under old bark of oak, elm and other trees, common. 
Homalota Mannh. To give some idea of the number of species of this 
1 For the determination of this and many of the following species I am indebted to 
Dr. Leconte. 
1 It may he not without interest to state that a species of Motschulskium, very prob- 
ably identical with M. s~uatocolle Matth., was found abundantly by Mr. Crotch at 
San Diego, Gal., under seaweed. 




================================================================================


genus, inhabiting the United States, it may be stated that about sixty spe- 
cies were found in the vicinity of Detroit in a single season. 
Calodera Mannh. 
Of this genus, which is very easy to recognize, three 
species were found near Detroit; three others are not rare in the marshes 
near Cambridge, Mass.; all the species live under very wet decaying 
leaves and moss. 
Oligota pedalis Lee. Very rare under decaying leaves. 
Myllaena fuscipennis Kr. Not rare under stones, etc., near the Detroit Riv. 
Dinopsis americana Kr. Under decaying leaves in fall and winter, not rare. 
'' myllaenoldes Kr. With the preceding, but much rarer. 
Tachyporus nanus Er. aud T. maculipennis Lee. Both are common in 
the grass at the foot of old oak trees. 
Tachyporus affinis Kirb. Rare in decaying fungus. 
Conosoma Knoxii Lee. Not rare in fungus, in the fall. 
Bolifobius niger Grav. 
Very rare in fungus. 
Bryoporus rufescens Lee., B. testaceus Lee., Mycetoporus lepidus Grav., 
M. americanus Er. and M. lucidulus Lee., occur rarely under decaying 
leaves ; M. flavicollis Lee. is common in the same localities. 
Heterothops fumigatus Lecl 
Common under decaying leaves. 
" push Lee. Very rare. 
Philonthus Uandus Grav. and Ph. laefulus Say are two quite distinct spe- 
cies; both are to be found not rarely in fungus. 
Xantholinus cephalus Say. Common under bark of several kinds of trees. 
Thinobius Kr. A single specimen of an undescribed species was found by 
sweeping on a swampy meadow; a second species occurs in California. 
Trogophloeus Maunh. 
This genus seems to be very rich in species, fif- 
teen or sixteen species being observed by us near Detroit. 
Isomalus pallidus Lee. 
A single specimen in a little ditch, after a heavy 
rainstorm. 
Pseudopsis sulcata Newm. .Several specimens in decayingffungus. 
Bythinus zonatus Br. Two specimens sifted from sphagnum moss. 
Trimium dub Lee. 
Not very rare under dry old leaves.

set, in the latter part of June. 
Anogdus laevis Lee. 
Several specimens under old bark, in August. 
Clambus puberulus Lee. On a window of a stable, not rare, in August. 
Orthoperus glciber Lee. and two other species of the same genus, by

PSYCHE. 
A CONTRIBUTION TOWARD A KNOWLEDGE. OF THE LIFk 
HISTORY OF CULEX SOLLICITANS. PLATE 1. 
BY JOHN S. SMITH, NFW BRUSSWICK, K, J 
The life history of a mosquito is ordinarily supposed to be rather a simple 
affair, and when egg, larva, pupa, and adult arc known and the stage in which the 
winter is passed, it is assumed that little more remains to be learned. Yet of at 
least one species this is so little true, that our knowledge of the ordinary life cycle 
is a mere introduction to a real history of the species. 
The species referred to is Cnlex so/Z/c/å´'/ Wlk., which breeds abundantly 
along the shore districts in New Jersey, and which I have had under close obser- 
vation during a portion of the season of 1901, and almost the entire season of 1902. 
Yet after carefully reviewing the results of the work clone and the observations made, 
it appears that there is at least one full season's work yet required to clear up the 
questions left unsolved or raised by what has been already learned, 
The salt-marsh mosquito is, from the economic standpoint, the most important 
species that occurs in New Jersey, and it is of New Jersey conditions that I intend 
to speak here. 
It dominates the entire southern half of the 
Slate and occurs in 
swarms where there is no chance of mosquito breeding for miles about, except in 
casual rain pools - and there the larva is never found. 
1 do not mean to contra- 
dict observations made elsewhere, or lo question conclusions drawn from such 
observations : I mean only to state actual facts and the deductions I make from 
them! It is quite possible that elsewhere, under other climatic conditions, these 
deductions may piove incorrect ; but it will need equally extensive observations to 
demonstrate this. 
The species passes the winter in the egg stage. 
This is demonstrated nega- 
tively by a failure to find adults at any time during the winter in quarteis whore 
the species is dominant, and where other species of CULEX and ASOPHELES may 
be found. 
Positively it is proved by the tact that very early in spring; swarms of 
minute larvae appear in winter-filled pools, as soon as the temperature reaches 50' 
Fahrenheit or over, and when not an adult can be found on the closest search. 
Early in April (4) larvae pretty well grown were found in Cape May County 
in pools, high above ordinary or even summer storm tides, formed by the heaviest

winter storms and already drying down. These were fotind after a day of search 
for adults in which Culexpunge/is and (probably) C rest-nans and Anophelespuiicfi- 
pennis were found; but no C. so/Zic//ans. The same story was repeated on the 
11th; and on the 19th and zoth, as the advance of the season cut off pools and 
ditches from tide connection, it was quite interesting to watch the appearance of 
the baby larvae in pool after pool and ditch after ditch. 
A pool in which on the afternoon of the 18th there was no trace of larvae, 
about which not an adult could be stirred up, swarmed with minute larvae on the 
morning of the 19th. They had hatched during the night, from eggs that were 
already in the water and that required only the proper temperature to bring them 
out. This pool had been severed from the tide not over 48 hours and the result- 
ing uniformity of temperature was sufficient to produce the proper condition tor 
the larval life. At this time the temperature of the sea water in a creek at halt 
tide was po. The temperature of the pools in which the young larvae appeared 
was 5z0, and the older pools in which larvae were nearly full grown were at s4", 
all I"ahrenheit. 
A very suggestive condition of affairs was found in a low meadow well above 
tide level, which had become filled with snow and rain and by drainage and formed 
a shallow pond about 4 acres in area. 1 know positively that this area was dry 
except in one low corner during the entire season of 1901 between May 1st and 
September I sth, and 1 am informed and believe that it remained dry until late 
December. 
At all times during the summer the meadow swarmed with C. so/Zici- 
tans and now, April 18, 1902, this entire area was inhabited by larvae of that 
species already nearly full grown; some, indeed, in the more sllallow areas were 
already in the pupal stage. Obviously the eggs must have been laid in the dry 
meadow during the summer, for at no time when mosquitoes were flying was there 
any water to lay them into. 
A large number of adults was bred from larvae gathered from pools ot all 
kinds, ranging from fresh to vciy salt water and, except in one instance, only C. 
sollidtans was bred. The exception was a single lot of larvae from a pool of 
brackish water from which C cantans was also obtained. 
The larva of C. .so/licitnns is light slate gray in color, the head yellow, without 
markings of any kind, anal siphon short and stout, antenna short, slender, black at 
the tip, without obvious set off or prominent tufting. The figure (111. I, fig. I) shows 
very fairly the appearance of the larva; the shape of the head and especially of the 
vertex being quite characteristic. Several other larvae resemble this and are not 
readily separable - notably those of C. cantans and C. laeniorhy~~chus. 
What happened in Cape May County between April 20th and June isth, 
when next I went there, I am unable to say; but the season had been very dry, 




================================================================================


pools were everywhere much reduced, swarming with larvae and pupae, while thc 
grass was filled with males. There were very few females and evidently, of the 
new brood just coming to maturity, only the males had yet emerged. A month 
later only a few bodies of water remained and they were drying up fast - so fast 
indeed, that thousands of larvae failed to come to maturity, and the half or quarter 
inch of water remaining in some pools was one squirming, wriggling mass. 
A systematic search was now made for the eggs and they were found in quan- 
tity after the right places were determined. Of the older females, flying July 8-20, 
almost all contained eggs, ranging from soft, white, through pearly, translucent, as 
the shell formed. to b1:iclz. Black eggs only were found in the meadows, well above 
the recent water line of such pools as yet remained, in the black mud in which 
their color made them almost invisible. It has been recently snggestecl that black 
is an unusual or exceptional color for mosquito eggs and that the habit of ovipos- 
king on land rather than water is exceptional. This may be true for Louisiana 
where the observations leading to that suggestion were made; but in New Jersey 
C. sollicitam certainly lays black eggs in black mud. No other color would do so 
well under the circumstances ancl, outside the body of the mosquito, I never saw 
C. sollii-itam eggs other than black ! From a piece of sod about 4 inches square 
I washed the surface nrud into a basin of water, waited until the whole settled to 
the bottom, to make certain that the eggs did not float, and next morning J had 
over 300 and possibly 500 lively young wrigglers. 
It is important to note, in this connection, that though Mr. E. I,. Dickerson (my 
assistant) and I collected several hundreds of specimens of mosquitoes betwecn July 
8th and 20th no examples of C. fae~zio-~~h~v~c/z?~s were sccn, nor had I at any time 
previously in 1902 collected C. tmiorhynchiis near this point. Neither was that 
species bred out of any larvae taken from the pools where we were then experi- 
menting. 
Two large sods were cut out of the marsh, well above any recent pools, and 
these were carried to New Brnnswick to serve for laboratory tests. One sod was 
kept entirely dry, the other was kept constantly moist though never covered wit11 
water. The presence of eggs in both sods was demonstrated by actual examination 
and, at intervals, small pieces of sod were covered with water and the results were 
noted. From the dry sod larvae were always obtained in a short time-from one 
half to one hour; from the, wet sod no larvae were obtained ancl all the eggs 
found were burst. 
Two lots of larvae from the dry sod were bred to niatnrity and all the adults 
proved C. taetziorhynchii.s! The larvae were those of C. sol?icitans except that they 
seemed undersized ; but the adults were unquestionably the other species. Finally, 
September 21, two n~onths after I took it up, I placed the remnants of the moist sod

PSYCHE [February 
in a large dish of water and next morning, to my great surprise, I found a fair lot 
of larvae. 
Out of these I obtained 8 adults and of these three were undoubted 
so//i~~itms.' 
It is a fair suggestion that there is something yet to be learned con- 
cerning the relationship between C. soZ/icifms and C fae?zim+ydzzis. 
The season at the point where the collections were made was phenomenally 
dry and all pools and ditches remained dry until September 5 or 6, when a heavy 
storm filled everything. On the iitli, Mr. Dickerson investigated, found every 
pool swarming with recent larvae, and brought up 20 small sods from ten separate 
places well above the pool line and which had been entirely dry since early July 
and probably a month before that date. All but two of these sods had been tested 
and had shown the presence of eggs, hence it was a fair conclusion that eggs were 
generally distributed all over the meadow. From eight of these sods larvae were 
bred in the laboratory. 
The eggs are spindle shaped just a little curved, shining, and when the larva 
batches the upper & lifts off as if by a hinge. 
Anothe~ obseivation made ~t Beach Haven early in August ~IHOWS further 
light 11pon the egg-laying habits of the species. 
A very heavy rain after a long 
dry spell, followed by a series of shovicis ci~11-ing which 3 or 4 inches of rain fell, 
lillcd every low area in the meadows with from 5 to J$ inches of water. Within 
wenty-fonr hours this entire area was swarming with larvae jnsi hatched and in 
forty-eight hours millions had perished because the water had disappeared: evap- 
orated by the hot sun or soaked into the parched soil. It would be easy to add 
to this further observations, all tending to the point thai the Female oviposits 
almost anywhere in the meadows, at the base 01 grasses; but it would seen1 as if 
tlie above were sufficient. 
I stated that, in early J~ily, tlieie was no trouble in finding gravid females 
and: indeed, almost all the femalcs t.ilien nere full of eggs. 
It is a curious fact 
that this coridii-ion was not agri-in duplicated later in the season. 
Fiom the beginning of Septembel to the middle of October collections were 
made daily on the Newark meadows! and from that time to the end of mosquito 
flight in November, collections were made at least once'and usually twice a week. 
Yet of the many hundreds of examples dissected not one contained mature eggs. 
~ ~ 
After a long period of drought which left the upper part of the Newark n~eadows 
dry, C soi/icitous became very scarce in early September. 
On the night of the 
4th and 5th there was a very heavy tide that flooded the meadows to the edge of 
the City, and covered the marsh tract at the mouth of the Elizabeth River. On 
the 6th Mr. H. H. Brehme, who made the meadows investigations for me, found 
everything swarming with recently developed larvae which grew rapidly as the 
pools gradually dried up. By the 16th almost the entire brood was mature and 




================================================================================


the pools were crowded with pupae and a small proportion of full grown larvae. 
The grass was now full of adults which made life almost unbearable unless some 
method was used to keep them off. The practical disappearance of the earlier 
broods before the new brood issued fixed the age of these specimens and there 
was no oher general brood that developed later on these meadows. I thought 
this a good opportunity to ascertain how long a time it would require for eggs to 
develop and 11:nce had the collections made daily for some time. Vet. at the end 
of the season 1 had no evidence that even one example out of the entire brood laid 
even a single egg ! Lot after lot was received with absolutely undeveloped 
ovaries and not even a single example was found having eggs ready to be laid ! 
The question is, did they lay any at all? In sods collected after the water had 
drained off none were found, and practically I do not know ;vheie the eggs are 
that will start C. sdhci1ans next spring. Dr. Dyar has suggested, in connection with 
another species, that of eggs laid in spring' some might hatch during the summer 
but that others would lie over until the season following. It is, of course, possible 
that the same thing occurs in this case and th.it unhatched eggs are yet on the 
meadows, ready to develop under favorable conditions next spring. As to the 
number of eggs laid by a female, the dissections made gave an average of about 
17s. A very few reached 200 and very few had less than i,jo unless the n~unber 
was very small. 
Another peculiarity of C. siilfu-itens in New Jersey is, its habit of travelling 
long distances inland, either by flight or by allowing itself to bc carried by the pre- 
vailing winds. 
After the middle of July the entire pine region of South Jersey 
gradually fills up with these insects, sometimes swarming miles from any water and 
forty miles from any point where C. soliicitans larva has ever been found. On two 
occasions I made systematic search during two or three clays, over a large area 
where C. soZiicitans was the dominant species, finding larvae of forms whose adults 
escaped attention, but none of the shore species. Nor did I ever find in the pines 
even one adult example in which the ovaiies were at all developed. August 
idth, I captured 253 examples in one area in Ocean County, by sweeping so as to 
get old, inactive specimens, and not one of these had the ovaries in the least devel- 
oped. A lot of 90 was captured a few days before by picking [.hem from the coat 
of the collector and these were found in a similar undeveloped condition. I 
omitted to mention that in these flights, so far away from home, the males have no 
prt -only the females wander. It is quite certain that none of the millions of 
these mosquitoes that infest the Jersey pines ever reproduce, because the surround- 
ings are not suitable; and it is almost equally certain that they could not if they 
had the opportunitj7, because the ova simply do not develop. 
The life period of the individual of this species is not determined; but it is

probably of considerable length, especially in those forms that do not reproduce. 
that they may bite more than once is certain, and direct experiment has proven 
that a full meal of blood may be so completely digested in one week, that scarcely 
a trace remains. The examination of a large number of specimens seems to indi- 
cate that blood food stimulates ovarian development, for in the great majority of 
cases wliere I found fully developed ova I found also blood remnants. 
In those 
cases in which such remnants were not found it cannot be safely concluded that 
such food had not been taken more than a week previously. 
But I did find numer- 
ous instances of ova starting development where the alimentary canal contained 
only a colorless liquid; probably plant juices. 
Larvae of C. soliicitans were not found after November 4, but adults continued 
until well along in that month. In shelters along the Newark meadows where C. 
/~&ititSiis, another salt water species, was found hibernating, not a C. solliciians 
occurred in December. 
Altogether the life cycle of this species offers points of interest that will 
require at least another full year to work out.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE GALL-WASPS AND THE PARASITIC 
CYNIPOIDS, OR THE SUPKRFklbfILY CYNIl'OlI>EA. I. 
BY N'ILLIAM H. ASHUEAD, A. >I., ASSTSTANT CURATOR, U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUN. 
In 1899, the writer separated the Hymenoptera into tm s~iperfa~nilies, viz. - 
(7) Apoidea, (2) Sphecoklea, (3) Vespoidea, (4) F'ormicoideal (5) Proctotrypoidea, 
(6) Cynipoidea, (7) Chalcidoidea, (8) Ichneur~~onoidea, (9) Siricoidea, and (I 01 
Tentl~redinoidea, and all of these have been classified clown to genera, except the 
Formicoidea and the Cynipoidea. 
During the year 1903~ in a series of papers in PSYCHE, I propose to give my 
views on the classification of the Cynipoidea, a large, natural group falling in 
between the Proctotlypoidea and the Cl~alcidoidea, and still imperfectly known in 
this country, altl~oi~gli well represented in genera and species. 
An excellent ~isz47d of the va1-ious schemes of classification proposeu for these 
insects by Hartig, Giraud, Thornson, F6rster, Wa1sh7 and others is given by Cam- 
eron in his Monograph of the British pliytopliago~~s Hymenoptera, vol. 3, p, 152 ; 
also by Kieffer in his Monographic des cynipides d'Europe et d1Alg6rie, vol. I, p. 
5 I, so that I sliali not repeat them here ; they should be read by all interested in 
these wasps, as they show briefly the great progress made in the study and classifi- 
'cation of these obscure insects, and how the nafz~m/g~uzs~s have been gradually 
evolved, until to-day they are firmly establislied, whether they be called tribes, sub- 
familiesl or fainilies. 
Most writers on these insects consider that they represent but a single family, 
the Cynipidae, with many subfamilies. In my opinion, however, there are at least 
tze~o well-marked families, nearly as first pointed out by Hartig. one of these com- 
prises all the parasitic species ; the other, with the exception of a single gro~~p, the 
I~ah%zae, comprises the gall-makers and the gall-inhabiting species. The Ihaliiaae 
are, however, a peculiar group and may yet be elevated to family rank. 
The two families may be recognized by the use of the folfowing table : - 
Abdominal tergites meetin~a~or~~ the venter and entirely inclosing or concealing the 
sternites, at most with only a part of the hypopygium exposed, 
Family LVI 11. - Figitidae. 
Abdominal tergites not meeting along the venter ; all or nearly all the sternites 
visible. Family LIX. - Cynipidae.

Family LVIII, -- Figitidae. 
This family is a most extensive one and well represented in North America. 
The species are numcrous and all, without a single exception, are parasitic. 
The 
majority attack principally the 1a1mae of Diptera; a few, however, prey ~ p n 
aphides and coccicls; others attack the larvae of the lace-xinged flies (He~ncro- 
biidae) ; wllile otl~crs are said Lo pey upon beetle larvae. 
Several well-marked natural minor gronps may be recognized, as follows : - 
Abdomen ovate, compressed or subcon~prcssed, often longly petiolate, the apex 
usually pointed . I 
Abdomen short, globose or subglobose, the second segment the longest . 5

This snbfamily is quite distinct from all the other subfamilies here recognized 
except the Onychiinae with which it agrees in all particulars except in the shape 
of the second dorsal abdominal segment, the second segment being nor~ual and 
not produced dorsally, or tongue-shaped, as in the latter group. 
The shape of the scutellum easily separates it from the Encoilinae and the

FOLS0M:ÌÔINSEC PSYCHOLOGY 
INSECT PSYCHOLOGY. 
BY JUSTUS WATSON FOLSOM, CHAMPAIGN, ILL. 
This article is intended to summarize, without much argument, some of the 
best approved views of the present upon this difficult subject. 
Insects are eminently instinctive ; though their automatic behavior is often so 
remarkably successful as to appear ra~ional, instead of purely instinctive. 
Instinct, as distinguished from reason, attains adaptive ends without prevision 
and without experience. 
For example, a butterfly selects a particular species of 
plant upon which to lay her eggs. Caterpillars of the same species construct the 
same kind of nest, though so isolated from one another as to exclude the possi- 
bili~y of imitation. Every cateipillar that pupates accomplishes the intricate pro- 
cess after the manner of its kind, without the aid of experience. 
Instinctive actions all belong to the reflex type,- they consist of coordinated 
reflex acts. A complex instinctive action is a chain, each link of which is a simple 
reflex act. In fact, no sharp line can be drawn between reflexive and instinctive 
actions. 
Reflex acts, the elements from which instinctive actions are compounded, are 
the inevitable responses of particular organs to appropriate stimuli, and involve no 
volition. 
The presence of an organ normally implies the ability to use it. 
The 
newly born butterfly needs no practice preliminary to flight. 
The process of sting- 
ing is entirely reflex; a decapitated bee retains the power to sting, directing its 
weapon toward any part of the body that is irritated, and a freshly emerged bee, 
without any practice, performs the stinging movements with the greatest precision. 
As Whitman observes, the roots of instincts are to be sought in the constitu- 
tional activities of protoplasm. 
The ostensible rationality of behavior among insects, as was said, often leads 
one to attribute intelligence to them, even when there is no evidence of its existence. 
As an illustration, many plant-eating- beetles, when disturbed, habitually drop to 
the ground and may escape detection by remaining immovable. We cannot, how- 
ever, believe that these insects " feign death" with any consciousness of the bene- 
fit thus to be derived. This act, widespread among animals in general, is instinctive, 
or reflex, as Whitman maintains, being, at the same time, one of the simplest, most 
advantageous and deeply seated of all instinctive peiformances. 
Take the many case=s where an insect lays her eggs upon only one species of 
plant. The philenor butterfly hunts out Aristolochia, which she cannot taste, in 
order to serve larvae, of whose existence she can have no fore knowledge. Ovipo- 




================================================================================


16 PSYCHE [February 
sition is here an instinctive act, not performed until it is evoked by some sort of 
stimulus - perhaps an olfactory one -from a particular kind of plant. 
Some determinate sensory stimulus is, indeed, the necessary incentive to any 
reflex act. The first movements of a larva within the egg-shell are doubtless due 
to a sensation, probably one of temperature. Simple contact with the egg-shell is 
probably sufficient to stimulate the jaws to work, and the caterpillar eats its way 
out; yet it cannot foresee that its biting is to result in its liberation. Nor, later on, 
when voraciously devouring leaves, can the caterpillar be supposed to know that 
it is storing up a reserve supply of food for the distant period of pupation and the 
subsequent imaginal stage. The ends of these reflex actions are proximate and not 
ultimate, except from the standpoint of higher intelligence. 
An action can be regarded as purely instinctive in its initial performance only, 
because every subsequent performance may have been modified by experience; in 
other words, habits may have been forming and fixing, so that the results of instinct 
become blended with those of experience. Thus the first flight of a dragon-fly is 
instinctive and erratic, but later efforts, aided by experience, are well under control. 
When once shaped by experience, reflex or instinctive actions tend to become 
intense habits. Thus, certain caterpillars, having eaten all the available leaves of 
a special kind, will almost invariably die rather than adopt a new food plant, 
whereas larvae of the same species will cat a strange plant if it is offered to them 
at birth. An act is strengthened in each repetition by the influence of habit, to 
the increasing exclusion of other possible modes of action. Many a caterpillar, 
having eaten its way out of the egg-shell, does not stop eating, but consumes the 
remainder of the shell,- a reflex act, started by a stimulus of contact against the 
jaws and continued until the cessation of the stimulus, unless some stronger stimu- 
lus should intervene. 
It lias been said that the larva eats the remains of the shell 
because they might betray its presence to its enemies. 
Whether this is true or not, 
to assume conscious foresight of such a result on the part of an inexperienced 
caterpillar is worse them unnecessary. 
With insects, as with other animals, many instincts are transitory; even when 
partially fixed by habit, they are replaceable by stronger instincts. Thus the 
gregarious habit of larvae is finally overpowered by a propensity to wander, which 
does not mature, however, until the approach of the transformation period. The 
reproductive instinct is another of those impulses that do not ripen until a certain 
age in the individual. 
Broadly speaking, instinctive actions lack individuality,- are performed in the 
same way by every individual of the species. The solitary wasps of the same spe- 
cies are remarkably consistent in architecture, in the selection of a special kind of 
prey, the way in which they sting it, carry it to the nest and dispose of it; all these 




================================================================================


19031 
FOLSOM:- INSECT PSYCHOLOGY 
= 7 
operations, moreover, are performed in a sequence that is characteristic of the spe- 
cies. 
Examples of this so-called inflexibility of instinct are so omnipresent that 
insect behavior as a whole is admitted to be instinctive, or automatic. Insects are 
capable of an immense number of reflex impulses, ready to act singly or in intri- 
cate correlation, upon the requisite stimuli from the environment. 
To normal conditions of the environment, the behavior of an insect is accu- 
rately adjusted; in the face of abnormal circumstances, however, demanding the 
exercise of judgment, most insects arc l~elpless. The specialization to one kind of 
food, though usually advantageous, is fatal if the supply becomes insufficient and 
the larva is unable to adopt another food. A species of SFHEX habitually drags 
its grasshopper victim by one antenna. Fabre cut off both antennae and then 
found that the SPHEX, after vain efforts to secure its customary hold, abandoned the 
prey. Under such unaccustomed conditions, insects often show a surprising stu- 
pidity, capable as they are amid ordinary circumstances. 
Notwithstanding such examples, the common assertion that instincts are 
"blind," or inflexible, is incorrect. Instinctive acts are not mechanically invari- 
able, though their variations are so inconspicuous as frequently to escape casual 
observation. A precise observer may detect individual variations in the perform- 
ance of any instinctive act,-variations which are analogous to those of structure. 
To take extreme examples, the Peckhams found that an occasional queen of 
Polir/e.rfusca would occupy a comb of the previous year, in place of building a new 
one. They observed also that one AMMOPHILA, in order to pound down the earth 
over her nest, actually used a stone, hcld between the mandibles. 
While most of the variations that one encounters are small and, in a sense, 
accidental, or purposeless, such novel departures as those of the POLISTES or the 
AMMOPHILA denote adaptability. 
Even the despotic power of habit may be overborne by individual adaptability. 
Among caterpillars that have exhausted their customary food, there are often a few 
that will adopt a new food-plant and survive, leaving their more conservative fel- 
lows to starve. 
As 
Darwin himself held, the doctrine of natural selection is applicable to 
instincts as well as to structures. All reflex acts are to some extent variable. 
Disadvantageous reflexes or combinations of reflexes, eliminate themselves, 
while advantageous ones persist and accumulate, 
Indeed, structures and instincts must frequently have evolved hand in hand. 
The remarkable protective resemblance of the K ALLIMA butterfly would be useless, 
did not the insect instinctively rest among dead leaves of the appropriate kind. 
Though manifestly dominant, instinct alone fails to account for all insect 
behavior. 
The ability of an insect to profit by experience indicates some degree 
of intelligence. 




================================================================================


18 PSYCHE [February 
If we take, as one criterion of intelligence, the power to choose between alter- 
natives, then insects are more intelligent than is generally admitted. 
The control 
of locomotion, the selection of prey, and the avoidance of enemies, as results of 
experience, indicate powers of discrimination. Honey bees sometimes utilize var- 
nish, pitch, and other substances as cements, instead of laboriously manufacturing 
their propolis from the exudations of plants. 
Again, an ant, having discovered food, returns and leads its companions to 
the prize; or one ant may summon others to its assistance. Here the power of 
intercommunication, conceded to exist among the social IIymenoptera, implies 
some amount of intelligence. 
If instinct is blind, or mechanical, with no adjustment of means to ends, then 
a pronounced individuality of action must signify something more than instinct, - 
as in the case of the AMMOPHILA. 
From the standpoint of pure instinct, indeed, much of the behavior of the 
social' Hymenoptera is inexplicable. The activities of the harvesting ants, the mili- 
tary or the slave-holding species, are of such nature that the possibility of educa- 
tion by experience and instruction is strong, to say the least. In fact, Forel and 
others maintain that a young ant is actually trained to its domestic duties by its 
older companions and that the well-known discrimination between friends and foes 
is also a matter of education. 
However intelligent the social Hymenoptera may be in their way, they show 
no signs of the power of abstract reasoning. Even ants, according to the experi- 
ments of Lubbock, display profound stupidity in the face of novel emergencies 
when they might extricate themselves by abstract reasoning of the simplest kind. 
The thoughts of an ant or a bee seem to be limited to simple associations of con- 
crete things. 
There are two leading theories as to the origin of instinct. 
Lamarck, Romanes, 
and their followers have regarded instinct as inherited habit; have supposed that 
instincts have originated by the relegation to the reflex type of actions that at first 
were rational, and that instincts represent the accumulated results of ancestral 
experience. This habit theory, however, has little to support it, and assumes the 
inheritance of acquired characters- which has not been proved. 
The stZec/ion theory of Darwin, Weismann, Morgan, and others has much in 
its favor. It regards reflex acts as primitive, as the raw material from which natu- 
ral selection, as the chief factor, has effected those combinations that are termed 
instincts. 
Finally, there is a growing tendency to regard instinct as the basis of intelli- 
gence. 
With the advent of consciousness, involving memory and choice, instinct 
ceases to be blind and reason begins.

SOME SPECIES OF EULECANIUM (COCCIDAE) FROM FRANCE. 
BY T. D, A. COCKERELL, EAST LAS VEGAS, N. MEX. 
Dr. P. Marchal has sent me five species of EULECANIUM collected in France. 
It might be supposed that these ithects, coming from such a country, WOUM be 
easily referred to well-known species; but as a matter of fact their identification has 
given me much trouble. Judging them by the standards of specific distinc~ion laid 
down by Signoret, they could all be regarded as new to science. However, it is 
now generally admitted that Signoret over-clivided his species, and an extreme view 
in the oppositc direction is held by Mr. R. Newstead, who writes me that in his 
opinion Lecanium cayreuz, gmewnse, and f~mzm {at least as understood in England) 
are one species; and further, that L.$e~sicm, ro~uruwz, and sa~ofhumni are also one, 
This surprising. union of species hitherto regarded as distinct must be taken seri- 
ously, for Mr. Newstead has gone over the ground very carefully, and would not 
make such a statement without excellent reasons. It was otherwise when Forster 
proposed to unite the whole series of EULECANIUM under the specific name mga- 
&~?24'2drn. 
The measureinents of antennae and legs in this paper are a11 in micromillime-

The paper is based wholly on fernaks. The tarsus is always measured 
without the claw.

BUTTON-BUSH INSECTS. 
BY JAMES G. NEEDHAM, LAKE FOREST, ILL, 
E~~tomologists who collect from flowers know how many insects gather about 
the heads of the button-bush - the "l~oneyballs" of popular nomenclature. 
These 
heads are conspicuonsly white, their frggrance is very marked, their nectar is 
abundant, often filling the corollas so full that short-tongued insects may sip from 
thein, and the psotandrous stamens heap their pollen upon the style lcnob, which 
then protrudes conveniently for the benefit of pollen feeders, By carefully 
ing these flowers through theis season, one may obtain nearly a11 the flower-visiting 
insects of his neighborhood. 
My own too brief season of butterfly collecting was spent at Piasa Bluffs on 
the Mississippi, where there were a few button.bns11 clumps along the 1-iver banks 
under the edge of the bluffs ; and there the butterflies swarmed -all the butterflies 
of that vicinity. They made a picture there wI1ic11 I shall always remember with 
delight. Dozens of them in a bright hued throng, poising on the swaying heads, 
or hovering over the dark green clumps that were set at the out& edge of a thin 
fringe of vegetation that stretched between the gray cliffs above the shining river 
below. 
The predominant visitors are butterflies, but this predominance is undidy 
apparent because these are so conspicuous. Robertson (Bot. gaz.; vol. 16, 65-66) 
lists 60 species of insects as visitors to the button-bush flowers. Of these 26 are 
butterflies and zo are bees. 
. I spent the summer of 1899 in Lake Forest; and there, under favorable condi- 
tions, began a study of the insects affecting the button-bush - not the transient 
visitors of the flowering season, but the resident insects that enter more closely into 
ecological rela~ions with it. I found some 30 species of these, and made some 
observations on the habits of many of them. I planned to continue my observa-

delight. Dozens of them in a bright hued throng, poising on the swaying heads, 
or hovering over the dark green clumps that were set at the out& edge of a thin 
fringe of vegetation that stretched between the gray cliffs above the shining river 
below. 
The predominant visitors are butterflies, but this predominance is unduly 
apparent because these are so conspicuous. Robertson (Bot. gaz.; vol. 16, 65-66) 
lists 60 species of insects as visitors to the button-bush flowers. Of these 26 are 
butterflies and 20 are bees. 
I spent the summer of 1899 in Lake Forest; and there, under favorable condi- 
tions, began a study of the insects affecting the button-bush - not the transient 
visitors of the flowering season, but the resident insects that enter more closely into 
ecological relations with it. I found some 30 species of these, and made some 
observations on the habits of many of them. I planned to continue my observa-

tions, but other matters came into my hands demanding all my time, and no further 
opportunity being now in prospect, I have concluded to publish such facts as are 
already gathered. 
I studied the button-bush in a shallow open pond on the country place of Mr. 
R. M. Bissell, within easy walking distance of my home, and in a "pot-hole" in the 
woods near by. The pot-hole was filled almost exclusively with a dense and tall 
growth of these shrubs. In the pond the clumps were scattered, low and broad in 
form, and were restricted to the borders of a flat island that lay in the midst of it. 
This pond is of several acres extent, and is hardly too deep for wading with hip 
boots anywhere. But it is being filled, by the land building of the button-bush 
around the borders of the island, and by that of the tussock sedges that fringe all 
its outer borders. Each summer it is reduced by evaporation to a few little pools, 
at which time the button-bush clumps stand upon a black soil that is fissured with 
deep sun-cracks. On the island, clumps of glaucous willow and red dogwood crowd 
the button-bush clumps in the rear, and they arc generally flanked by some or all of 
the following weaker plants : CaZmnagrostzs camzdensis, Paniczdariafluilans, Carex 
utriculata, Dit2i;:hium spathactwm, Spfirganium eurycarpm; Sag'Utaria variabilis. 
The clumps here are impenetrable thickets. Muskrats build their huge hum- 
mocks under them, immensely furthering the land-building process; tree frogs 
climb the gray trunks, and red wing blackbirds build their nests in the tangled 
branches. The density of their growth excludes other large plants, but an interest- 
ing group of weaklings nestle in their shadows: Viola /;latzda, Scutellaria galerim- 
lato Galium trifidtdrn, and Onocka sensibilis. At the surface of the water the 
trunks are closely enwrapped by a moss of the genus Amblystegium. 
The 
button-bush is our only woody representative of the madder family. 
Coffee is akin to it, and most of its relatives are tropical shrubs. 
It is not well 
adapted in some respects to our latitude. 
It develops only unprotected buds, that 
are killed each winter together with the terminal shoots, the new growth from 
adventitious buds in spring being late in appearing. One result of this, with a 
bearing on the insect life found associated with it, is that the shoots of one season 
are lateral to those of the preceding season, and the growth is scragged, and there 
are many dead tops, broken ends, and exposed pith cavities. 
Very few insects have been recorded from the button-bush hitherto, aside from 
the flower visitors. Dr. Packard in the 5th report of the U. S. entomological com- 
mission mentions three, two of these notes being citations of earlier records by 
Harris and Riley. 
These are : - 
1. Platysamia cecropia (Linne), p. 402. 
2. CaIIosamia promethea (Drury), p. 525. 
3. Hyphantria cunea (Drury), p. 249.

These are all general feeders on foliage of woody plants. 
An undctermined 
tineid from Cephalantht~s is mentioned in Insect life, vol. 3, p. 18. 
These and 
Robertson's list of visitors to the flowers, are the only records 1 have found. When 
beginning my study I wrote Dr. L. 0. Howard, asking him whether the records of 
the Division of entomology of the Department of agriculture included other species, 
and he kindly sent me the following list: - 
I. Harrisitnemna trisignata (Walk.). 
2. Laverna cephalanthiella Chamb. 
3. Aphis cephalanthi Thomas. 
4. An undetermined cecido~nyiid. 
In my own studies I have come upon only the first of Dr. Packard's list and 
the third of Dr. Howard's. I will now give my own list, omitting all flower .visitors 
except such as are not included in Robertson's list, arranging them by orders first 
with notes and observations, and concluding with a summary list according to 
habits. 
LEPIDOPTERA. I. Melanomma auricincta~ihn Grote. Pupae of this species may 
be found singly in pith cavities excavated in the broken ends of dead stems about 
half an inch in diameter, during the entire winter and early spring. They are 
found also in cavities excavated in the bark of the thickest of the fallen stems, 
generally a number near together, where conditions are favorable. The cavities in 
the bark are short and tortuous, and are directed toward the surface at the end and 
cut almost, but not quite through, by the larvae before pupating. The pith cavities 
in standing stems have the appearance of excavations of the wasp DAHLBOHMIA, 
(No. 7 post'). Although this is perhaps the most abundant of the Lepidoptera 
found on the button-bush, larvae were not observed. A good many heads of fruit 
were found still hanging in winter, wilh holes bored through them transversely to 
the seeds ; I did not find the borers. I thought they might perhaps be the larvae 
of this species, but found no proof. From pupae collected for breeding, images 
emerged in May. They were determined by Prof. C. H. Fernald. 
2. Ac~onycta ohhnita (Smith & Abbot). This is a common leaf feeder. Its 
larvae when newly hatched are ramblers, feeding here a little and there a little, but 
when they are older they feed at the tips of the flowering shoots. They begin at 
the top, eating the leaves off down to stubs of the petiole, thus consuming generally 
two, sometimes three or four pairs of the opposite leaves, and then removing to 
another shoot. When not feeding they are often to be found resting in seclusion 
on the gray bark of the preceding year's growth. They are very frequently 
parasitized, especially by the big red Rhogas rileyi (No. 8 post); and the parasi- 
tized individuals settle upon the stems, first overspreading them with a thick mat of 
silk, attach their feet, and then at their death there exudes in the thoracic region a 




================================================================================


brownish fluid which hardens and glues the old skin to the silk. RHOGAS emerges 
through a big ronnd hole cut in the back of the larva, but the empty larval skin 
may hang through several seasons, until bleached and weathered and bare. I 
have found a number of them in early spring still attached, and well preserved. 
I bred many parasites from the larvae of this species, but only one moth; that 
one emerged on the 20th of July from a cocoon that was spun by the larva in the 
top of a SCIRPUS stem, within a nest made of deflexed bracts and flowering 
branches fastened with silk to the side of the stem. That specimen and specimens 
of the three next following species have been determined by Prof. John B. Smith. 
3. Eudryas grata (Fabr.). 
A single pupa of this species wasfound in spring 
under the bark of a fallen button-bush stem, in a well-formed pupal cell, and was 
bred indoors, the handsome moth emerging in May. 
4. &ofis j@si?on Rolt. ) 
A number of moths of these two species were 
5. Plusia simplex Guen. J seen visiting the button-bush flowers for nectar at 
dusk. 
6. flatysamia cecropia (Linn6). 
A single egg cluster of this species was 
found on a button-bush leaf; and the larvae were hatched at home on July 2d. 
Four small larvae were found in another place on a single leaf a few days there- 
after. 
HYMENOPTERA. 7. Dahlbohmia needhami Ashmead. This species shares the 
terminal pith cavities with MELANOMMA (No. I ante), but is much less common. 
The first specimens were found in winter, hibernating in their cells as pupae. Ima- 
gos were bred from these in May. 
On June 26th I first saw the live wasp. It was 
a female, busily engaged in excavating the pith in the end of a broken stem. She 
would descend into the stem and after a few seconds back up to the surface and 
scatter some fine white pith chips, descend again instantly, and repeat. I marked 
the place and returned the next day to find her storing her completed nest tunnel 
with aphids - nymphs of RHOPALOSIPHUM sp ? and CHAITOPHORUS sp ? I 
captured her then, and examined the nest, and found one cell completed and closed, 
and a second one half stored. 
The completed nest consists of four or five cells arranged end to end in the 
cavity, separated by partitions of fine pith chips, the thickness of the partition 
being about equal to the diameter of the cell. It appears that the first boring into 
the pith cavity is not of the full diameter of the cells, and that the chips made in 
finishing the walls of each cell, except the bottom one, are used to form the parti- 
tion separating it from the one below it. 
This species and the three named Hymenoptera next following have been 
determined by Dr. Wm. H. Ashmead. 
8. Rhogas rikyi Cress. This big parasite of Acronycta oblinita has already

been mentioned under the account of that species. It is sufficiently common to 
serve as an efficient check upon the depredations of the larvae of that species. 
The 
larvae are generally killed before they are grown. 
My bred specimens of the 
parasite are labeled the 18th and the 21st of June. 
9. An undescribed pteromalid, in the hands of Mr. Ashmead for description.

Bred on the 5th and 6th of June in 
great numbers from the male scales of Eulecamum armeniacum 
(No. 16 fost), 
which they completely annihilated. 
12. Chalcis annulata Fabr. Found on button-bush stems, but not further 
observed. 
13. Sobla excava Norton. A pair of sawflies of this species was captured 
in July on a well isolated clump of button-bush. 
A number of sawfly larvae were 
taken feeding on the same clump on the 27th of June, some of them apparently 
grown. - These larvae fed only on the young and tender leaves of the sterile 
shoots. They were hardly gregarious, and in their feeding, they ate but a few 
small holes in each leaf. Mr. A. D. MacGillivray determined the adults, and I 
have supposed that the larva belong to the same species. 
HEMIPTEKA. 14. Nenrocolfius nubilis Say. This species and the two next 
following were the only ones that appeared to be getting their living exclusively at 
the expense of the button-bush (Awonycta obZinita fed also on the leaves of the 
tall dock, Rumexaltissimiis, on the island). This rather prettily red-marked capsid 
was seen feeding about the buds 
of the flowering shoots, nymphs only being 
present in May, and adults appearing about the middle of June. 
Determined by 
Mr. 0. Heidemann. 
15. Aphis cephalanthi Thos. A few colonies of this aphis were found on 
flowering shoots that overhung the water. Their bluish powdery covering gave to 
the shoots which they thickly covered a decidedly glaucous appearance. 
In the 
colonies were found foraging the larvae of the anthomyiid (No. 22) and the cocci- 
nellid (No. 31) mentioned below. 
16. EiiZeca?~/u-~i armeniacum Craw. This scale was very common during the 
winter of 1898-99 on shoots of the preceding season ; but it was excessively par- 
asitized with CoccophagusflavoscuteZZum, and I have not been able to find a specimen 
since that season. I placed hundreds of the male scales in a proper breeding cage 
in April, and hundreds of the parasites emerged, but not a single male scale insect.

on the plant lice. ~hough legless they could adhere to the convex surface of a bare 
stem or crawl about upon it. The living larvae are whitish, with a covering of 
bluish powder similar to that of the aphids, and there are on the middle of the 
back several darker M-marks, connected in the middle by an interrupted middorsal 
line. Some larvae were observed pupating in the midst of- the aphis colony, attach- 
ing the puparium to the stem. The puparium is at first yellowish, but later it turns 
reddish brown. From puparia collected here a number of imagos were bred, and 
these and the lollowing Diptera have been determined by Mr. D. W. Coquillet~. 
23. EjIphragsna fascipennis Say. 
Larvae of this species are vei-y common 
under the bark and in the sap wood of watersoaked button-bush steins that lie 
upon the mud. 
They are able to burrow through rather solid wood. Larvae of 
different sizes may be obtained almost any time. Transformation takes place 
mostly between the middle of May and the middle of June. A full account of this 
species with figures will appear in my forthcoming second report from the N. Y. 
entomological field station.

This and the following Coleoptera, have been determined by Mr. Samuel Henshaw. 
32. Telephoym carotinus Fabr. 
This lampyrid beetle lives as a larva among 
the roots of the button-bush, and in the mat of moss that usually overspreads them; 
it transforms frequently under the bark of a dead stem, sometimes in the pith 
cavity of a short and thick stub when low enough to be kept sufficiently moist,

and the images are commonly taken on the foliage. 
The species, being carnivo- 
rous, probably has no relation to the button-bush except through its relations with 
other insects. 
Larvae were found among the roots and moss in early spring; pupae were found 
early in May, and one of these, with the larval skin still enveloping the apex of the 
abdomen, and serving for certain identification, was bred on the 18th of May. 
About the same time two- tencral images were found among the moss enwrapping 
the roots of a button-bush. I have previously recorded (Amer. nat., vol. 34, p. 
371) that fully matured beetles are con~monly found eating the nectar flowing from 
weevil wounds at the base of the flowers of the blue flag. 
As the immature stages of this interesting beetle seem not to have been 
described hitherto, and as it is of somewhat different type from the larvae of other 
well-known Lampyridae, I deem it worth while to add descriptions herewith of larva 
and pupa. 
LARVA : -Length 19 mm., abdomen 11.5 mm., width of head 1.5 mm., of abdomen 3 mm. 
Body nearly cylindric. dorsnm well rounded, widest across the base of the abdomen, and 
tnpering somewhat to both ends. Body segments of neai-ly equal length, those of the base 
of the abdomen being slightly shelter and wider, at the sides well rounded, with evident con- 
strictions between the segments. 
Coloration obscure; liead dark chestnut. brown, paler about the base of antennae and 
mouth-parts. 
Bod! olivaceous above, paler below; skin finely granulate and covered with a 
tine and dense pubescence which gives it a decidedly velvety appearance. Thorax with a pale 
median longitudinal line, and( )-marks at the sides of each segment with a large brownish, 
longitudinally placed, elliptical mark on each side midway between the ( )-marks and the 
median line. Abdominal segments each with avery narrow, pale, basal, median, longitudinal 
line or dash. eilher side of which ib a similar oblique, nearly transverse, dash; farther out on 
thu sides of the segments and much- farther backward are two broader dashes on either side. 
These are placed side by side and a sinuous, and continuous, paler longitudiual line extends 
between them. Farther down upon the sides is a less distinct, similar line in which the 
spiracles arc situated. 
Headquadrzngular; longer than wide,slightly narrowed jnst before tlie hind margin,thinly 
clad with yellow, spinous hairs. Labral margin squarely trm-icatc, with a low broad quad- 
rangular tooth in the middle, isolated by a minute cleft of tlie margin either side of it. Mandi- 
bles long and strong, regularly arcuate and tapering to a 5trong point, with a simple strong 
tooth on the inner border at two thirds their length. Eyes bead-like projections "upon the 
lateral margin at the base of the Einlennae, Antennae two-jointed spinous, the second joint 
slightly longer than the first, obliquely truncated at the tip with the longer angle the internal 
one, and bearing on the end an external flabcllum, and a slightly longer, conical rudiment of 
a third joint which in length about equals the width of the zd segment. Basal segment of 
both labium and maxillae lying in one plane and densely covered below with a growth of 
spinous yellowish hairs, There are abundant 
hairs also on the ventral side of the mentnm 
of the labium, and on the apical margins of all the remaining segments of both maxillae 
and labium. The maxillary palpi are +-jointed, the length of the segments from the base

outward being to each other as I : 3 : .3: 1.2, and their widths being as I : .8: .6: .A decreasing 
to apex, this last segment being conical. The lacinia of the maxilla is oblique at base and 
straight and conical in its distal three foul-lhs, this part being set off by a constriction on the 
inner side. The menlum of the labium is trapezoidal, widest in front, wl~ere occurs a slight 
notch on the median line. The basal segment of the labial palpus is cylindric and about as 
long as the mentutn; the 2d segment is a third as long' and half as wide at base and tapers 
to a point. 
The legs of the three pairs are alike save for very slight dill'ei-ence in size; femora and 
tibiae are of equal lengtb coxae one third shurier, trochanters one half shorter, and tarsi two 
thirds shorter. The tarsus is I-jointed, including the claw, merely tapering into a straight, 
and at the last, slightlydecurved tip. It is beset about its base by 6-10 stiff approved spines, 
while tlw lee tliruiighout me sparsely clal will1 yelloil-ibh hairs. The 9th segment of the 
abdomen is one third narrower than the 8th and tlie 10th is one half the width of the 9th and

spines about as long as the distance between their tips. 
The whole surface of the body is smooth. 
A broad, dark, dorsal band nearij covers the 
abdomen and there is :I line of dashes either side of it. 
The large spot of the prothorax of 
the imago appears in the old pupa very distinctly, and also the paler markings about the 
bases of the antennae and there is a dark blotch upon the metathoracic scutum. 
Bred at Lakc Forest, Ill., 18th May, 1901. 
33. Macrofsfwcell'us (Say) ? 
A standing dead stem of button-bush was found 
to be infested with larvae, and was put in a breeding cage in the spring and this 
beetle emerged in the cage. Uniortunately, the gummed label on the vial in which 
I kept the specimen became loosencd and was lost, and with it all further data 
concerning this insect. 
NEUROPTERA. 34. Sisyra z~mbrata Needham. 
While working in a button-bush 
clump I one day accidentally injured a tree-frog that was sitting, perfectly concealed 
by its color, on one of the trunks: and having thus made it necessary to kill the 
frog, I examined its stomach, and there I found for the first time this species. 
The frog had eaten six of the spongilla flies. By a little careful searching I soon 
found a few specimens sitting on the button-bushes. I found also the larvae crawl- 
ing about on little knot-like growths of Spongilla /rag& attached to submerged 
twigs and trunks of the button-bush as well as to other solid supports of any sort. 
It is therefore a natural, though quite an incidental associate of the button-bush.

Larvae of this species are found occa- 
sionally under button-bush trunks that are lying in the edge of the water, and I 
found one pupa that had ensconced itself neatly in the pith cavity of a stub of large 
size that projected from the open water. This pupa I reared, the imago issuing 
on the 3 I st of May. 
ACARINA. 
36. An undetermined mite of very small size makesa felted gall 
on the leaves of the most vigorous shoots. The mites live on the under side of the 
leaf between the veins in the midst of the reddened hypertrophied plant hairs which 
fill the concavity that quickly develops. Frequently the gall becomes distinctly 
sacculate, rising to a considerable height 
from the upper side of the leaf, and 
becoming almost a mantle gall. It is of irregular shape, with warty surface, and is 
reddish in color, or green, tinged with reddish. 
Besides the foregoing, there were at least four other species of insects that 
certainly belong to the button-bush population, but which I have been able neither 
to find out about, nor to name. These are a jassid whose nymphs were common, 
feeding on the leaves in June, but which I did not breed. A number of ja-ssid 
images might be swept from the foliage in midsummer but whether they were there 
by accident was uncertain; an undetermined coleopterous larva that 1 took to be 
one of the Oedemeridae which I found repeatedly under the bark of dead stems; 
and two species of ants undetermined that were taken often about the colonies of 
APHIS and EULECANIIJM. 
The ecological relations of tlie members'of this assemblage of insects are not 
without interest. 
A numbcr live in the dead stems only. Of these, four live in the 
pith cavities of br6ken stems: Lwo (nos. i and 7) in the dry tops, and two (in the 
pupal stage only, nos. 32 and 35) in the wet stubs. Five live under the bark, three 
(nos. I, 3 and 32) as pupae only, and two (nos. 23 and 33) feeding as well as 
transforming there; two of these live only in wet stems (nos. 23 and 32). Nine of 
our list (nos. 4, 5, 24-30) are merely flower visitors. Two feed on the green stems 
and these (nos. 15 and 16) are among the most important enemies of the Imtton- 
bush. 
Ten are leaf feeders (nos. 2, 6, 13, 14, 17-21, and 36, the last being the 
only gall maker observed) and among these only one (no. 2) seemed of much 
importance to the plant. Of the three prime depredators, therefore, the moth 
larva (no. 2) and the scale insect (no. 16) have their internal parasites of the usual 
sort, and the aphid (no. 15) has its predatory larval dipterous (no. 32) and coleop- 
terous (no. 31) foes. Three aquatic insects of our list (nos. 24, 34, and 35) are

natural associates of the button-bush, requiring similar habitat, but their relations 
with it are of the most tenuous sort. Among all the insects named only three, and 
these three, Hemiptera (nos. 14-16), appeared to be getting their living entirely at 
the expense of the button-bush, and of these three the first was not very common, 
and the other two were beset by most efficient enemies.

natural associates of the button-bush, requiring similar habitat, but their relations 
with it are of the most tenuous sort. Among all the insects named only three, and 
these three, Hemiptera (nos. 14-16), appeared to be getting their living entirely at 
the expense of the button-bush, and of these three the first was not very common, 
and the other two were beset by most efficient enemies.

REVIEWS. 
A Nature Wooing at Ormmd by the Sea. 
By W. S. Blatchley, State 
GeoIogist 01 Indiana. 
245 pp., 12 pl., 62 cuts, map. Indianapolis, Nature Pub. Co. 
Entomologists contemplating a winter trip south sho~~ld not fail to read this 
. graphic account of collecting experiences, conditions, and the results obtained 
during March and early April in the vicinity of Ormond, Fla. In addition to the 
many interesting biological notes incorporated in the text. there are appended lists 
of the Odonata (18 species), Orthoptera (30 species), Heleroptera (20 species}, 
b~itterflies (27 species), and Coleoptera (55 species), secured. ln this appendix 
the author has unfortunateIy published the description of a new species (Eritetlix 
syZz)est~is-Acridiiclae), a practice which cannot be abandoned too soon. The 
proper place for such puhlication is in the columns of the regular scientiGc journals 
or other works of recognized technical character. 
In addition to the entomological notes the volume contains an account of the 
Ormond shell mound and sufficient information of general interest to entitle it to a 
place in the luggage of every tourist. A. l?. MORSE.

France. 
This important work, representing volume 7 of Andrb's Species des Hyrngn- 
optGres d'Europe et d3A1gdrie, has just been received. 
Unfortunately, not many Americans are yet familiar with this great work of 
Anddl which was begun some years ago by Mons. Hmond Andrd, and since his 
death, is being completed by his brother) Mons. Ernest Anclrd, a noted hymenop- 
terologist, who has engaged some of the best European specialists to help him out 
in certain fa~niiies: Rev. T. A. Marshall in the Braconidae) Robert du Buysson in 
the Chrysididae, etc. 
The volume before us is written by Abbd J. J. Kieffer, better known for his 
work in the Diptera, and treats of two subfamilies of the Cynipidae or gall-making 
wasps -the Ibaliinae and the Cynipinae, It is a large octavo, contains 678 pages, 
and is illustrated by 2~ plates, each plate being crowded with figures showing the 
structural characters of these wasps and the galls or deformations caused by them 
on various trees and plants. 
The work is admirably planned. After a brief introdueti~n ~hb6 Kieffer 
enters minutely into the general characters of the Cynipidae: the head, thorax, 
abdomen, and their appendages are taken up in order and accurately and fully 
defined.

PSYCHE [February 
JMore entet-ing into the systematic account of these insects, he discusses fdly 
their early stages-the egg: egg laying: larva, and pupa. 
The biology of the 
Cynipidae shonld come iu here hut is only briefly touched, 
The Alh6, however, 
says : '' Nons ne donnons ici que g6116raIities sur la biologie cles Cynipes, en nous 
reservant de tmiter cette question plus longuenient PILE tard pour chacune des cinq 
ti-ihs dans lesquelles on r4parti ces insectes," 
A good bibliography of the Cynipidae follows ; this appears 10 l x fairly com- 
plcte, the list of papers given numbering '342. No reference, however, is made to 
Saussure's genus Obertl~iirella, dcscrilxd fl-om Africa, a reimrka1Ae form falling in 
my subfamily Liopterinae. 
Abb6 Kicffer gives a good rest11n6 of the various schen~es of classification 
pruposed for these insects, and has recognized five tribes, viz.: (I) Ibaliinae 
(2) Cynipinae, (3) Allotriinae, (4) kcoilinae, and (5) Figitinae. 
This arrangement is good ; it is substantidly Ftirstcr's classification, who 
called the tribes families, Ibalioidae, Cynipoidae, etc., except that Fihter had two 
additional fatnilies, the Megapclmniclae and the Onychioidae. Kieffer has evi- 
dently merged these with his tribe Figitinae, to which tiicy are undonbtedly closely 
allied, having originated from a common steni. 
In the opinion of the witer, the families of E'tirsier are mtwd ~ V I @ X , 
although probably not of equal value, a d all should bc accepted in the sense of 
tribes and subfamilies. The terniination of these natural groups, whether in 
oidae. ida, ides, idae, ina, inae or ini, is of seconda~-y iniportance, ~lntil a uniform 
system, for indicating families, snbfamilies and tribes, is established. 
The Cynipides of the oldel- authors, I think, represent a superfamily- the 
Cynipoidea, with two very distinct families? the Figitidae and the Cynipidae, nearly 
as was first pointed out by Hartig- in 1840.' 
In 
my own systematic work in the Hymenoptera, I have conscientio~~sly 
endeavored to define clearly the families, subfamilies and tribes, making use of 
the endings idat, iaae and iki to designate each, respectively, so that no mistake 
can be made as to what the groups really represent. 
The groups recognized by KiefCer as tribes are really natural groups, first 
pinted out by Thornson and Forster, and should be accepted, whether. they he 
called families, subfamilies, or tribes. 
The first subfamily treated by Kieffer is the Ihaliinac; it is represented by 
ol~ly a sing1e.species in Europe, while in America we have several species, 




================================================================================


The tribe Cynipinae of Kieffer, includes both the genuine gall-makers (our 
Cynipinae) and the inqi~ilines or con~niensals (our Synerginae). He begins with 
an excellent table for recognizing the galls found on all trees and plants except 
those found on oak trees; the galls fonnd on the oak are tabi~lated in a separate table, 
Eac11 species of oak is then taken up separately and a good table of the galls found 
on each is given. All the tables are full and clear, and will be fo~md of incal- 
culable value to the student; they make the identificz~tion of the numerous 
EUI-opea11 cynipidons galls easy. 
Kieffer devotes many pages to the origin, for~i~ation, and structure of galls, the 
uses they al-e put to, and to l~eterogenesis and parthenogenesis. It is the most 
interesting part of the work and sho~~ld be read by all. 
111 a11 excellent dichoto~nons table of the genera of the Cynipides gallicoles, 
pages 239 to 257, IGefFer defines 22 genera. He descl-ibes one gen~~s, PANTE- 
LIEI,T,A, as new. It is allied to I)IAS~ROPI~JS, but is easily separated by the meso- 
notum being longitudinally striate, by the clam being feebly denticdate, and by 
the 1-elative length of the second antenna1 joint. 
'J'his tablc of genera does not include all the Imown genera. of thc gall-making 
Cynipids, but only those found in E~~rope; other exotic genera American, African, 
etc,, not includcd in the table, are, however, alluded to in footnotcs. 
In going through 
this work, one feature that especially co~nnicnds itself is 
the compiled list of thc commensals and parasites bred from cad1 species or gall 
that terminates the dc~cripti~~ll. Much time and labor have been expended in 
compiling these lists; thcy are, howcvcr, of immense value, not only as an aid to 
the identification of the species, but on account of the great insight they give in 
regard to the habits and parasitism of the many species involved in these reasings, 
Because a parasite is bred from a cynipicl gall it does not necessarily follow 
that it attacks the gall-maker; it may or it may not; it n ~ y come from some of the 
comme~~sals, coleopterol~s, lepidoptcrom, neuropterous, etc,, often fonnd in galls, 
The importance oL this is well 111-ought out by Kieffer's list of cornme~~sals and 
parasites bred from a common ro~t-~ll on oak, Bio~hiza $aZZida Oliver, arranged 
in two col~m~ns. 
Here it is :

PSYCHK. 
THE DIFFUSION OF INSECTS IN NORTH AMERICA. Plate 2.l 
BY F. M. WEDSTER, URBANA, ILL. 
The abundance and diversity of insect life during the warmer months are suf- 
ficiently striking to attract the attention of even those not especially interested in 
insects. To others of a more inquiring mind the questions arise as to the means 
by which they came, and, being here, how it is that they are able to remain. It is 
to the first proposition that this discussion will be directed. 
Thc careful observer of insect life will not fail to remark the gradual changes 
that arc constantly taking place in the insect Canna of any single area of country. 
Some species, on account of changed conditions, due largely to the industries of 
man, are disappearing, while others, before unknown, arc, or seem to be, taking 
their places. Probably there are few scientific men who have not, again and again, 
had the question put to them in this way: "Is there a constant creation of new 
insects going on, or are these we see only the old ones ? " The question is easier 
asked thm answered, but I shall try to throw some light upon the somewhat obscure 
problem by an arrangement of a portion of the data at present obtainable, and 
which tend to throw light upon the subject not so much of insect creation, as of 
insect diffusion. But at the outset I must call attention to the fact that this kind 
of research can only follow on after considerable progress has been made in classi- 
fication, and considerable knowledge obtained of the structure and habits of the 
forms entering into the problems which we are to study. Again, as elsewhere in 
the realms of zoological science, it somctimes occurs that affinities may appear in 
the earlier stages of development and disappear entirely in the later stages. For 
this reason we cannot even yet in many, perhaps the majority of eases, work out 
our problems with a feeling of assurance that we have reached conclusions that 
are final and may not, in the future, need revision. But no progress is made in any 
science without effort, and some failures are inevitable, so that, generally speaking, 
the best results are only such until some one else does better. 
Insect diffusion began in America a long way back in the obscure past, just 
how far we do not know, but the remains of an ancient insect fauna have been pre- 
p - ~~p p -.

PSYCHE [April 
served for us in the rocks and shales, so that we are given a point from which to 
begin our investigations. Perhaps the Tertiary deposits in Wyoming and Colorado, 
though including but a mere fragment of the vast host of insects that must have 
been entombed in the rocks, have yielded us the greatest amount of information 
relative to the ancient fauna of America, containing as they do, and in profusion, 
not only representatives of every order of insects known to-day, but types of every 
dominating family which at present exists. We have also been further fortunatc in 
having so faithful a student as Mr. S. H. Scudder to study this material, for it con- 
tains not only numberless bodies of the more stable insects like the Coleoptera, but 
even those of APHIDIDAE and microscopic parasitic insects, whose bodies are of thc 
most fragile nature. We are thus put in possession of facts that go to show that, as 
to-day, the aphides were probably in part viviparous, and wc have besides the spe- 
cial sexual forms of the ants and the triungulin larva of the MELOE thus preserved 
for us. A study of this material has given us some surprising facts. 
Among the 
most significant, and quite apropos to our subject, is the fact that a careful inves- 
tigation of the Rbynchophora obtained, as compared with the forms now existing in 
this country, shows that the recent American Rhynchophorous fauna agrees better 
in its broad features with the Tertiary fauna of Europe than with the Tertiary fauna 
of America. Though possibly a little in advance of its proper place, it may not be 
entirely out of order to call attention here to a fact well known to entomologists 
and especially to lepidopterists; viz, that where a species is found both on the 
Atlantic and Pacific slopes, and which also occurs in Europe, individuals taken 
from the Pacific coast region are more nearly like those found in Europe than are 
those found along the Atlantic coast. 
In a list of Coleoptera common to both 
this country, northern Asia, and Europe, published by the late Dr. John Hamilton, 
in 1889, 487 species were enumerated, and an almost immediate revision 01 this 
paper by the Swiss entomologist, M. Alfred r'anvel, added eight more to the list. 
In these lists, however, no distinction was made between such as were introduced 
in articles of commerce and such as came in a strictly natural manner. Thus it 
will be seen that even in Tertiary times, as also in our recent past, there has been a 
close relationship between the insect fauna of North America, northern Asia, and 
Europe. 
Geologists are in possession of sufficient data to show conclusively that, during 
some period of the world's history, the region about the Arctic circle enjoyed a cli- 
mate as temperate as we have at the present time, wliilc the region now included in 
the northern United States abounded in tropical animal and vegetable life. Thus 
there might have been, and probably was, a free intercourse between North America 
and northern Asia via the northwest, and, possibly, with Europe via the northeast; 
but of this last we are not so certain. At present, while insects from the eastern

hemisphere in many cases readily become naturalized in North America, it is veiy 
rare indeed that the reverse is the case. The reason for this is not understood, nor 
do we know for a certainty how far back in the past these conditions have obtained ; 
but tlie general opinion among entomologists is, that the trend of diffusion was from 
the northwest and not toward it. 
But there came a tremendous climatic change, and the northern ice sheet 
plowed its way southward, crushing and grinding the rocks into sand, clay, boulders, 
and pebbles, leveling down the elevations, filling up the channels of rivers and the 
beds of lakes, at the same time transforming the once tropical country into that of 
the frigid north. How long this condition continued we do not know ; but while it 
did continue, all intercommunication from northern Asia and Europe by the way 
of the northwest was necessarily cut off. Presumably the ice sheet began to melt 
away along its southern border in the now United States, gradually uncovering the 
land to the northward. How rapidly this area was again covcrecl by vegetation and 
reoccupied by animal life we do not know; nor can we state how far beyond the 
termination of this ice sheet the flora and fauna had been obliged to retreat. We 
know that, in our day and in case of the present glaciers, one can almost stand on 
the edge of the ice and collect insects of the temperate zone; but this really proves 
nothing in the case of the huge ice sheet covering millions of square miles of area 
and being probably hundreds of feet in thickness. Hut, be these facts as they may, 
it seems very probable that the country as fast as it was uncovered by the receding 
ice became occupied by plant and animal life from the south. Indeed, it hardly 
seems possible that the trend of diffusion could have set in from any other direc- 
tion ; but how much of a basis for this diffusion was left along the south Atlantic 
and Gulf coasts we do not know. 
-Reoccupied by plant and animal life, we have a country as first discovered by 
the white man, comprising an immense inland plain, the eastern border bulwarked 
by the Appalachian mountain system, low and broken, it is true, and by the much 
more stupendous and continuous Cordilleran system to the west, open to the Gulf to 
the south and to the frigid zone to the northward. This area, now known as the 
basin of tlie Mississippi River, because of its being largely drained to the south by 
that river and its tributaries, was comparatively level, and though heavily timbered 
to the south and east, was scantily or not at all timbered to the west and north. 
The drainage to the north, being by the Saskatchewan into Hudson Bay and the 
Mackenzie into the Arctic Ocean, was, perhaps, a less potent factor in thc problem 
of restocking this country with insects. We have now three natural gateways, so 
to speak, through which insects not introduced by commerce must make their way 
into North America. These are by way of northern Asia into Alaska, and thence 
south and east; by way of Central America, through Mexico; and by way of the

West Indies into Florida. 
Relative to the last I may be permitted to give a word 
of caution. 
South American forms may reach Florida by two lines of diffusion; 
one by way of the Antilles, the other by way of Panama, Yucatan, and Cuba, as 
illustrated by Halisiclota citripes. 
We will now take up each of these several gateways of natural dispersion and 
discuss them separately as the northwestern, the southwestern, and the southeastern 
sources of diffusion, after which we will consider another series of avenues taken 
by such species as have been introduced into North America through the agency 
of man. 
(See m1-p. Roreczl trend, F. F.) 
It is obviously impossible to discuss all the species, or even genera, that appear 
to have come to us, or perhaps rarely gone from us, via this direction. I have, 
therefore, selected the Coccinellidae, or lady-beetles, as an illustration, for the rea- 
sons that the species are common, well known, and generally diffused over North, 
and in some cases over South, America, and that the family is represented gcncr- 
ally over the world, species of the genus SCYMNUS having been found in America, 
Europe, New Zealand, Galapagos and Hawaiian islands, and also in the American 
Tertiary deposits in Colorado and Wyoming. For illustrations I have as a rule 
selected our most common species. Coccinella 5-?zotifta occurs in Siberia, Alaska, 
Hudson Bay, Greenland, Kansas, Utah, California, and Mexico. Coccimlla Ma- 
sciafa occurs in Lapland, Siberia, Oregon, and about Lake Superior. Harmonia 12- 
maculata occurs from Siberia to Hudson Bay and Lake Superior. 
Megilla macu- 
lata, one of our most common species, occurs from Canada and Vancouver south 
to Chile, with a larger variety of it occurring in Brazil. Jiriups connexa occurs 
from Vancouver to the Straits of Magellan, and though confined to the west coast 
in North America extends to the east coast in South America, and has been taken 
on the Andes at from nine to ten thousand feet above the sea. The common 
fi'ppodizmia parenthesis, a representative of }f. amoena in Siberia, occurs from 
Oregon to Kansas and New Jersey. It is one of our most numerous and bene- 
kid species. Cuccine/Za 9-wtafa. even more abundant and beneficial, occurs from 
Canada to Guatemala. Coccinella affinis occurs from the Lake Superior region 
southward to Honduras, while C. sunguinea occurs all over North America and 
from Alaska to Patagonia. 
Species coming from the eastern to the western hemisphere do not necessarily 
occupy the same climatic areas in both. The following will suffice to illustrate this 




================================================================================

point. 
Lina lapponica, one of the Chrysomelidae, in Europe occurs only in the far 
north and on the highest mountain ranges, feeding, as with us, on willow ; but in 
North America it has become diffused in the lowlands to the southwest part of the 
country, from Alaska to Texas. A vile-odored carabid beetle, Nomiusfygmaeus, 
occurs only rarely in southern France, Hungary, and Greece, while in North Amer- 
ica it is found in the Appalachian mountain system from Georgia northward to 
Nova Scotia, and in Canada, Washington, and Oregon, thus describing in its distri- 
bution an almost complete half circle. How it ever reached this country is still a 
mystery. These instances are cited here in order to show that it is not at all extra- 
ordinary for insects to be found in the far north in the eastern hemisphere and in 
die far south in the western. 
Again, insects found in high altitudes in the tropics may be closely related to 
others occurring in the lower lands farther to the north. A good illustration of this 
is offered by a species of Hemiptera belonging to the genus EMESA, found almost 
directly under the equator at an elevation of 16,500 feet above sea level,-the 
highest altitude at which animal life has ever been found,- but whose nearest ally

of not over five or six hundred feet. 
(See map. A, Pacific Maritime: å£ Tropical SubaJpine : C, Atlantic Maritime.) 
We will now pass to a consideration of diffusions from the southwest. 
Central 
America and Mexico have long seemed to me to be biological headquarters, veri- 
table insect nurseries for the propagation of new species to be sent northward. It 
is here that we have the greatest wealth of material and, I regret to add, the least 
knowledge thereof, for these countries are far more healthy for insects than for 
entomologists. I never see a collection of insects from that country, or read of 
those that are known to occur there, that I do not devoutly hope that some institu- 
tion with funds to be devoted to research may have this lack of information 
brought to its notice. 
In discussing the northward diffusion of South and Central American forms, I 
shall be obliged to select two or three genera as typical, and with but an occasional 
exception confine myself to them, though others might be chosen. as illustrations 
nearly or quite as satisfactorily. 
The old genus HALISIDOTA, among the moths, and DIABROTICA and MYO- 
CHROUS, of the Coleoptera, though perhaps no better illustrations than others, are 
such as I am best acquainted with, having given them somewhat careful study.

PSYCHE [April 
The home of the HALISID~TA certainly appears to be in South America. 
There are many forms in Central America and Mexico that require further study 
before much can be said of their relationships, but that many of the species inhabit- 
ing the United States originated in these countries, the offshoots of South Ameri- 
can forms, can hardly be doubted. There is a form very closely resembling our 
H. tesscllaris and, in fact, Dr. Dyar informs me is son~etin~es so labeled; which is 
found from Argentina northward, at least as far as Costa Rica. As we can trace 
many of our species southward to Yucatan, it seems not unlikely that this may 
prove to be the stem from which both H. fessellaris and H. citri$esl have sprung. 
It will be observed that the former has spread over the eastern United States, and 
the latter to Texas and Florida, by what appear to be two separate courses; one 
almost directly north and the other east by way of Yucatan and Cuba into Florida 
(Atlantic Maritime, C. C. C. and a, b, on map). In the north Atlantic coast 
region H. tessellaris has thrown off what is known as II. harnsii, the adults of 
which cannot be separated; but the larvae of the latter can subsist only on the foli- 
age-of the sycamore, while those of the former will perish if placed on the sycamore. 
Halisidota carye follows almost exactly the distribution of II. tessellaris, but there 
is evidently a splitting up somewhere in Central America, as H. agassisii (Pacific 
Maritime? A. A, on map), which closely resen~bles it, extends northward into Cali- 
fornia, where it appears to be displaced by II. auE/;/tfcra with its variety ahti, the 
former being the low coast form and the latter the mountain form of If. -niacii-Iata, 
which last species extending into the mountain regions of Oregon, Washington, 
ancl British Columbia, sweeps broadly to the eastward through the extreme north- 
ern United States and Canada to Nova Scotia and New England. If this theory is 
correct, we have a species entering North America from Central America, passing 
north along the Pacific coast to British Columbia, and making its way east and south 
with the tide of diffusion from the northwest. Dr. Harrison G. Dyar, of the United 
States national museum at Washington, to whom 1 am indebted for information on 
this point, thinks it quite possible that Hi inac'n/da may have originated in this 
manner and that H agassizii is the stein, thcrc being somewhere to the far south 
a connecting link between the latter ancl H. cmyze. 
What may be leimed the H qeiifnfa system (Tropical Subalpine, B, on 
map) extends from southern Mexico to Vancouver, sending out H. suhalftina 
into Arizona and Colorado, and the coast species, H sobrina, into California. 
Another system, H. edwmdrii, in all probability emanates from Hi hemiJiyalea, in 
southern Mexico or even farther south, extending into the Sierra Nevadas of Cali- 
fornia, but down in Mexico H. labecuJa is thrown off, and extends along the Rocky 
Mountains north into New Mexico and Colorado.

What is now known as Phyo/tem [7s//ir Crainer occurs in South America 
north to Arizona and New Mexico. Heterocampa Iwiiidata occurs from Panama 
through Guatemala and Mexico to Florida and New England. Macrocawpa mar- 
thesia is known from Brazil through Central America to Texas, Georgia, and Maine. 
The two latter species do not occur on the Pacific slope. 
'She genus DIABRUTICA. of the Cl~rysoinelicIae,offers some good illustrations 
of the diffusion of species of Coleoptei-a from the far south to the north into 
North Ainei-ira. There are in Columbia and Venezuela, about one hundred known 
species of ~~)I.:~BROTICA, of which eleven extend into Guatemala, eight into Mexico, 
and one into the United States. Several of our most common species of this genus 
can be traced directly to Central America, -0. longicornis having been found in 
Yucatan. I11 fact, with but a single exception all of our fifteen North American 
species can be traced into Mexico, and some even farther. Only recently a 
Mexican species, Diabrotica $eregrim, has been found just over the Rio Grade 
River, at Brownsville, Texas. Elsewhere (Journ. ent. soe. N. Y. vol. 3, p. 158-160 ; 
vol. 4, p. 67) I have discussed the diffusion of the genus at considerable length, 
and it is unnecessary to repeat here what was there stated, except to call attention 
again to the fact that our D. viftata has a very close relative in D. trivifhzta on the 
Pacific coast, and that our D. 12-pnnctafa has an equally near relative in D. soror, 
also of the Pacific coast, while in each case there is an intermediate species that 
seems to connect the two. This phenomenon I attribute to the fact that the 
original stein species may haw become separated far to the south, and one branch 
followed the Pacific and the other the Atlantic Maritime trends, and Professor 
Cockerell's D. vitfafa var. kc&, coming between the former and D. t/-i7d/ata, 
would seem to give us an illustration of an intermediate species in the process of 
evolution, while in B. tridnda, which occupies a similar relation to D. 12-punctata 
and D. soror, the evolution has advanced further and we have what we term a 
good species. From some more recent studies of Myoh~ous de~~ticollis and allied 
species of that genus, it would seem that sonicthing similar might have taken place 
with reference to the northeastward trend of diffusion. Since mapping the distri- 
bution of the genus MYOCHROUS in the Unitcd States, in 1901,' I have found that 
Af. squamosiis occurs in Illinois and Kentucky, thus indicating that the latter, like 
A[. deniicollis, has swept broadly to the north and eastward. 
The common Dynastes tityus occurs from Brazil throngh Central America and 
Mexico, and in the United States from Texas to Illinois and east to southern New 
York and New England. The Cotton boll weevil, A~z/hommis grandis, which is 
spreading its devastating hosts through the cot~on fields of Texas, was unknown on

in the vicinity of Brownsville, Texas. Among the Hemiptera or true bugs the 
Chinch-bug and the Harlequin cabbage-bug offer excellent illustrations of the 
trend of insect diffusion from the ~outhwest.~ 
(Autillean trend, D, on map.) 
Of the remaining entrance gate, that of southern Florida, I will say that there 
is no doubt that many species have made their way up through the Antilles 
from South America. The distribution of Calidota strigosa illustrates that fact, and 
there are many other illustrations : but as the United States has recently gained 
such a supremacy in the Greater Antilles, we may confidently look for considerable 
activity in the study of the insect fauna of these islands, and I would rather not 
anticipate the results of this work. I believe, however, that we shall find the 
Central American and Mexican route the more imp~rtant.~ 
In taking up the introductions by the agency of man, I should like to approach 
that subject by here calling attention to what appears to have been such an intro- 
duction of Aphodius lividus,3 which must have become established at a point some- 
where in the West Indies, from whence it has spread to Florida, and from there 
pushed its way westward to extreme southern California, entering the state at a 
point where the mountains are more easily passed through, and started up the 
Pacific coast. This is a new line of diffusion, and quite a suggestive one as well. 
I have recently discussed this trend of diffusion quite at length4 and it is 
unnecessary to repeat what I have there stated, except to stnte that the Appala-

chian system does not approach the Gulf coast at its southern terminus, but leaves 
a broad avenue that enables species moving eastward to pass on along the Gulf to 
the Atlantic coast and thence northward. It does, however, to the northward form 
an almost impassable obstruction to the directly westward migration of insects from 
east to west, broken only in the State of New York and the country adjacent to the 
north and south shores of Lake Erie. Here we have a huge gateway through 
which nearly or quite all species imported from Europe, landing on our eastern 
seacoast, north of the mouth of the Potomac River at least, make their way into 
the comparatively level country beyond. Even the Atlantic Maritime brachypter- 
ous Chinch-bug followed this trend. It is barely possible that the valley of the Big 
Kanawha River in West Virginia and Cumberland Gap may offer passageways for 
an occasional species, but of this we have no proof as yet. In the Cordilleran 
system 
there do not appear to be any such openings or gaps for the influx 
and diffusion of migrating species, except, perhaps, in extreme southern California 
and Arizona, a country so arid that few species can take advantage thereof if it 
really exists; hence, a separation in South or Central America usually remains 
permanent, while in 
the case of European species and the Appalachians, they 
might easily make their way south along the Atlantic coast to the Gulf, and in a 
comparatively short time mingle with the northern branch that has made its way 
west to the great lakes and thence southward. 
A peculiar feature of the problem of introduced insects is that, although we 
may have knowledge of their habits in their native homes, this is not always to be 
taken as limiting their actions in this country. The wcll-known household pest, 
the carpet beetle, Anthyemu sc~o//;u/ariae, occurs along the Pacific coast, having 
doubtless been introduced from Asia, but it does not there attack carpets. Soon 
after it was introduced into the country along the Atlantic coast it began to destroy 
carpets at a terrible rate, and it is now one of the most destructive of household 
pests. I can well remember when it was unknown in Illinois, where now it does 
much injury. In its native home it is a flower-frequenting insect, and I ran always 
find these beetles here in the United States in early spring in the blosson~s of 
tulips, more especially those of a white color. The allied species, A~z/hr~itiis7~~~~7~~.~, 
also introduced, though a noted museum pest, is at about the same season to be 
found frequenting the blossoms of the Spiraea. These illustrations go to show the 
extreme flexibility of insects, not only in the matter of food but nearly every other 
condition that enters into the problem of their diffusion and development. 
Generally speaking, insects are as plastic as clay in the hands of the potter, and we 
need only to look to their immense numbers and variety to find proof of this.

identity, as species are understood by the present-day entomologist. 
If a foreigner 
lands in Quebec, Canada, or Baltimore, Maryland, it will sooner or later find its 
way to Buffalo, New York, and westward along the shores of Lake Eric, into the 
great level country beyond the Appalachians, feeding probably, but not necessarily, 
on the same food plants that it ate in its home in the eastern hemisphere. 
In the eighteenth century it was thought sufficient for naturalists to state that 
such and such species inhabited North America. In the nineteenth century we 
decided that we must state whether a species was found in Connecticut or Rhode 
Island, but it would suffice if the statement were made that it was found in Illinois, 
notwithstanding that there is more difference between the insect fauna of northern 
and southern Illinois than there is between the latter state and Ohio. In the 
beginning of the twentieth century we have come to the conclusion that labels, 
giving the states only, without more explicit information as to localities from which 
the specimens to which they are attached have been obtained, are of little value to 
the student of morphology, or in tracing out the distribution of species ; nevertheless 
we cannot entirely overcome the old prejudice relative to political lines forming 
biological boundaries. At present, there is nothing for the American entomologist 
beyond the Rio Grande River. Of course we know that there are insects there, 
but, by an unwritten law of our ow11 construction, we prohibit ourselves from know- 
ing much of their identity or affinities to species found on our own side of that 
river. Mexican and Central American species are either excluded from our col- 
lections, or, if admitted, are crowded down in the corners and labeled, if indeed at 
all, as foreign ! Thus the most interesting territory in the western hemisphere and 
what to us is really the most significant, as from out of it whole genera of our insect 
fauna have been evolved, remains aln~ost a terra incognita. Let me illustrate. A 
pl~ytophagous species starts from South America on its way northward. Even 
while passing through Central America as well as through Mexico, it is obliged to 
encounter a diversity of climate, elevation, and food supply. The species in adapt- 
ing itself to these modifying influences becomes shattered as it were and the frag- 
ments are found in Texas, in New Mexico, Arizona, and California. We find these 
and with the least possible delay, and with no knowledge of their affinities or, in 
many cases, developmental stages, they are described as so many species and 
added to our checl~lists. Can stability in our nomenclature be expected as long as 
these conditions continue? These same influences are at work in California, and 
we can see their effects plainly enough there, though both conditions and results 
are only modifications of what is probably going on farther to the south, and they 
are of proportionally less value in aiding us to solve our problems in biology and 
nomenclature. Other modified influences, similar to those at work in California, 
may be noted in connection with the Antillean and Boreal trends of diffusion, but 




================================================================================

none of these, nor in fact all of them combined, appear to influence our entomolo- 
gical fauna to the extent that is probably exerted by the southwestern trend of dif- 
fusion. The Transappalachian trend of diffusion appears not to exert any such 
influences, and individuals of introduced species do not vary from those in their 
ancient home in the eastern hemisphere. 
I have attempted to make my position more clear by the construction of a map 
that shows the various trends of diffusion of which I have spoken. Since so little is 
known of species occurring in Mexico, Central America, and the Antilles, and their 
affinities to our own, it is folly to expect that such a map can be made more than 
tentative, but it is a beginning. Criticism will provoke investigation, and, in any 
case, some good must come of it and our knowledge be increased. It is not to be 
supposed that the area covered by these lines is proportionate to the territory cov- 
ered by the diffusion itself; the lines only indicate directions. 
The Pacific Maritime trend of diffusion may include such species as inhabit 
this coast or such as are forced down or drift down from tlic higher areas and estab- 
lish themselves. Some, like Hnlisidota angzdifeuz in California, have a subalpine 
form, like H, aim. The Chinch-bug also is not confined to the sea level, but prob- 
ably finds the least resistance to its progress there. This trend ot diffusion is indi- 
cated on the map by the line A. The Atlantic Maritime trend is to be looked 
upon as occupying a similar position on the east coast, and may be the avenue 
along which the Panipcan forms make their way from the level areas of South Amcr- 
ica into those of a similar character in North America. 
But there is probably the 
same intermingling of tide water and subalpine forms as on the west coast. It must 
be continually kept in mind that, though the two coasts are, in Central America, 
often separated by comparatively short distances, yet the climate is as different as 
might be expected to exist between localities hundreds of miles apart. This latter 
trendis indicated on the map by the line C, and the Pampean range by a, because 
insects that subsist on grasses, or such plants as are to be found in treeless areas, 
will be more likely to push northward along the base of the rocky mountains and 
then spread broadly to the eastward than will arboreal species that must hold more 
closely to the wooded sections. Thus, the Diabroticas evidently hold to the north 
from Mexico, while the Halisidotas must keep to the eastward. Both may spread 
up the Mississippi River, as the country is both wooded and grassy. As I have 
shown elsewhere, the Chinch-bug may have followed both the Painpean, a. a, or the 
main trend, C. Of course the Mississippi River trend, b, lay open to it, but inun- 
dations would probably have impeded its progress. The Tropical Subalpine trend 
may be illustrated by the a?gm~;å´a/ system of the Halisidotas, and by other forms 
or the high altitudes. The Antillean trend, D, is illustrated by the many tropical 
species that have clearly entered Florida from the south, and not by the way of

Central America and Cuba, the latter being a branch of trend C, the possible 
coursc of D being indicated on the basis of the trend of diffusion of the intro- 
duced Aphodius Jivzdus. Cylasformicarius, the pest of the sweet potato, may have 
followed this course, but of this the proof is lacking. The Antillean trend may, 
and again may not, extend northward, as in C. What I have termed the Trans- 
al~palachian trend, E, is intended to indicate the trend of diffusion especially, 
though not cxclusively, of species introduced through the agencies of man. Most 
of these, whether they become established along the coast from Virginia north- 
ward, or in Canada as far up the St. Lawrence river as Quebec, make their way 
into New York and west, passing between the low mountains and the south shore 
of Lake Erie into the comparatively level country beyond. The Boreal trend, F, 
from the northwest, may perhaps follow more closely to the coast, as indicated by 
the dotted line, but sooner or later it sweeps broadly to the east to the Atlantic 
coast and New England, not infrequently sending subtrends into California, Col- 
orado, and even Mexico. I have not indicated southward trends so fully, because 
there are less of them; they are less important to this discussion, and too many 
lines, especially in the tar south, would complicate and obscure the map, the land 
as shown being too narrow to display them clearly separated.

This group was first recognized as a subfamily by the writer about ten years 
ago, and I am surprised therefore, to see that Dr. von Dalla Torre takes credit for 
it in Wytsman's Genera Insectorurn, Family Cynipidae, received January 27, 1903. 
He, and some other writers, placed the group in the subfamily ANACHARINAE, but 
its resemblance to that subfamily is merely superficial, the attachment of the abdo- 
men, the abdomen itself, and the antennae being quite different. 
In the publication quoted above I suggested that the group was probably an 
ancient phylum of the Cynipidae whence originated some of the Chalcidoidea, 
CHALCIS, EURYTOMA, etc. Since the suggestion was made additional evidence sup- 
porting it has been found in the African genus OBERTH~RELLA Saussure, occurring 
in Madagascar and Liberia, a genus belonging to this group, not mentioned by 
Dalla Torre or by Kieffer, and which has the hind femora slightly swollen and 
armed with a tooth beneath, similar to some chalcidoids.

the family Figitidae, the genera and species being- exceedingly numerous although

In a lot of parasitic Hymenoptera, sent to me by Prof. T. D. Alfken, of the 
Stadtisches museum fur natur-v6lker-und handelskunde, Bremen, Germany, 
was a single male specimen of an oryssid, collected in 1899 by Dr. Hugo H. 
Schauinsland, in the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand. 
It is an interesting form belonging to a genus not yet known to occur on these 
Islands, the only other species known from these regions being from Aru. 
OPHRYNOPUS SCHAUINSLANDI, sp. nov. 
$.-Length 6.6 mm. Black, the head rugose-punctate with an aeneous black tinge, the 
forehead tubeiculate, the face with two carinae that diverge anteriorly and are connected 
with a transverse carina bounding the front margin; thorax shagieened; legs wholly black, 
the hind tibiae serrate on outer face, armed with about II teeth ; the first three being very 
minute. 
The wings are hyaline, with the apical third or more of Lhe front wings fuscous, the 
stigma and veins being black or brown-black. 
The abdomen is as in ORYSSUS, black and shining, but with the first four or five see- 
ments above more or less shagreened and faintly, sparsely, microscopically punctatc. 
Type in Bremen Museum. 
The species is dedicated to Dr. Hugo H. Schauinsland, the Director of the 
Museum.

with a transverse carina bounding the front margin; Lhoriix shagreened; leg's wholly black, 
the hind tibiae serrate on outer face, armed with about I I teeth ; the first three being- very 
minute. 
The wings are hyaline, with the apical third or more of Lhe front wings fuscous, the 
stigma and veins being black or brown-black. 
The abdomen is as in ORYSSUS, black and shining, but with the first four or five seg- 
ments above more or less shagreened and faintly, sparsely, microscopically putictatc. 
Type in Bremen Museum. 
The species is dedicated to Dr. Hugo Ha Schauinsland, the Director of the 
Museum. 
1These genera probably represent males in genera at present known only from the females, and I therefore do not 
name them.

PI? YCHE 
A- CATALOGUE OF THE BEES OF CA 
[April 
BY T. D. A. COCKERELL, EAST LAS VEGAS, N. MEX. 
In the Report of the Agricultural experiment station of the University of Cal- 
ifornia for 1898-1901, recently published, Mr. Carroll Fowler gives an account of 
the long-tongued bees of California. 
This is a very useful paper, so far as it goes, 
and Mr. Fowler has been able to make important additions to our knowledge of 
California bees. Unfortunately, however, the paper was prepared in 1899, and has 
not been brought up to date; consequently it omits numerous species recorded 
since that year, and is not altogether modern in the matter of generic nomenclature. 
It also omits several species published before 1899, and in a good many cases the 
names of species are incorrectly spelled. 
In some cases, I am inclined to doubt 
the identification of the species, but unless I have actual knowledge to the contrary, 
I must for the present treat all published records as correct. 
The list here presented includes also the short-tongued bees of California, for 
completeness' sake. It need hardly be said, that we know comparatively little about 
California bees; it is quite certain that any student who takes up this group in 
California will find very numerous new species. 
The list now offered is intended 
to be of service to such a student or students, as it is hoped that the publication of 
Mr. Fowler's paper will have created an interest in the bees.

LIFE HISTORIES OF NORTH AMERICAN 
GE0METRIDAE.-XL. 
BY HARRISON G. DYAR, WASHINGTON, D. C. 
Qcia cognataria Guende. 
The egg has been noticed by A, P. W. Cramer and 
there are several good descriptions of the mature larva extant, besides 
a poor 
figure, published by Lintner. The larval stages have not been before noticed. 
I am indebted to Mr. H. H. Lyman of Montreal for the eggs, which hatched 
before arrival. The larvae fed readily on maple, but are, apparently,rather general 
feeders. 
EGG. 
Elliptical, roundedly and distinctly flattened above and below, ends rounded and 
much alike, no distinct flattening of inicropjlar end nor marked depression of the other end. 
Reticulations distinct, in longitudinal rows, forming waved ridges, the cross striae being a 
little weaker than the longitudinal lines. Reticulations confused at the ends, and less 
strongly marked. 
Size .6 X .4 X 4 mm. "Color bright green. Laid loose in large num- 
bers " (Lyman). 
STAGE I. 
Head rounded, bilobed, full, blackish over the lobes, dull sordid on dypeus 
and mouth ; sutures of clypeus deep, well marked; width about .3 inin. Body normal, mod- 
erately robust, whitish, becoming sordid green from the food ; a dull purple, broad, subdor- 
sal band, obscurely joined intersegmentally on the abdomen and completely so on joints 
10-13, separate on thorax; a broad, diffuse, dull purplish ventral band, later resolving into a 
series of medioventral patches. Thoracic feet black, abdominal ones dark outwardly. 
Tubercles black, small, normal ; setae inconspicuous. Cervical shield colored like the body, 
undifferentiated, but anal plate and anal leg shields triangular, broadly blackish edged. 




================================================================================


STAGE 11. Head rounded bilobed, squarish, a depression at apex of clypeus ; width .5 
mm. Body moderately robust, normal, subventral fold rather prominent. Greenish and 
brown, mottled, nearly all green along the subvcntral fold, venter and dorsum more brown, 
especially about the feet. Head reddish brown, reticulate in lighter, ocelli black; feet dark. 
Anal feet and shield reddish, resembling the head. 
No plates ; tubercles obsolete. 
STAGE 111. Head high bilobed, flat before, lobes rounded, projecting above the ciorsum, 
pale yellowish sordid, thickly mottled with brown ; width .8 mm. 
Body rather robust, 
normal, venter somewhat flattened. Pale yellowish, this color showing- on subvential fold 
but elsewhere thickly mottled in dead leaf brown. Thoracic feet pale greenish, foot of joint 
10 dark brown outwardly. 
Anal shield lighter brown, resembling the head. 
A white patch 
on each side of clj-peus and across it more faintly. 
STAGE IV. 
Head high bilobed, flat be-fore, lobes subconic, projecting rather widely; 
brown, mottled in white before and also a little with smoky, a blackish arc at apex of cly- 
pens ; sides less strongly mottled; width 1.3 mm. Body rather short, moderately robust, 
normal. Smooth green, overlaid with a brown shade, most distinct at the contracted ends ; 
joints 2-4 and 10-13 slightly shining, without defined markings, only the faintest traces of 
pale lines showing at the ends, 
STAGE V. 
Head high bilobed as before, red-brown, mottled with white, which forms 
curved streaks on the faces of the lobes ; vertex behind and sides at neck dark shaded; width 
2 mm. Body cylindrical with a process on joint 9 bearing tubercle iii, rounded and cushion- 
like; no cervical shield, anal plate triangular, anal foot plates large, elongate, with stout anal 
prongs. Light red-brown to dark sordid brown, irregularly shaded, darker on the anterior 
halves of the segments, darkest ventrally. 
Feet dark at base. Setae short, stiff, black, from 
indistinct tubercles. 
STAGE VI. 
Head high bilobed, flattened before, lobes forming low cones, widely sep- 
arated by a broad notch ; clypeus rather high ; surface shagreened ; wood brown, mottled 
and shaded with dark brown, darkest in a small patch at apex of paraclypens ; width 3.6 mm. 
Body cylindrical, stout, joint 2 slightly collared at the anterior edge and angled subdorsally, 
the angles dark and preceded by pale marks which are exposed or concealed according to the 
position of the larva; third pair of thoracic feet usually extended while the first two pair are 
appressed; a slight ventral prominence on joints 6, 7, and 8 bearing small spines ; a large 
lateral conical prominence on joint 9 above and before the spiracle with black spines ; a low 
rounded collared hump on joint 12, marked in pale subdorsally. Feet normal, a white sub- 
ventral fringe between those of joints 10 and 12 ; anal plate and leg shields large, gray. 
Body green, more or less marked with gray and brown, sometimes mostly brown. The gray 
occurs in segmentary hands, darkest on joints 9 and 12, the abdominal feet gray. 
Dorsum 
brown shaded. Thoracic feet light reddish with nearly black shading at the bases. 
Spiracles 
reddish. Skin with many secondary granules, mostly white, hut becoming black spines on 
the humps and clav-ate, capitate papillae in the subventral fringe of joints 10-12. Primary 
setae pointed, black, from small black tubercles, normal except that about five setae represent 
tubercle vii. 
The larvae transformed to large red-brown pupae in the earth and hibernated 
in this stage.

80 PSYCHE [April 
NOTES ON SOME ALEYRODES FROM MASSACHUSETTS, WITH 
DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES. 
BY AUSTIN W. MORRILL, B. SC., MASSACHUSETTS AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, 
AMHERST, MASS. 
In hi5 Contributions toward a monograph of the American Aleurodidae (U. S. 
dept. agric. Div, ent. Bull. Tech. ser. 8, goo), Quaintance reports only one species 
of the genus ALEYRODXS (EAleurodes of some writers) as occurring in Massachu- 
setts or even in New England, and this, the greenhouse Aleyrodes (A. vaporahrum), 
is probably not a native species. As a whole the genus appears to be most typical 
of the warmer climates, a large proportion of the described North American species 
being found in Georgia, Florida, California, and Mexico. 
In New England except for the greenhouse (A. va$orarforiim) and the straw- 
berry (A.fackardi) Aleyrodes, conditions do not seem favorable for their occurrence 
in large numbers. It is probable that the difficulty with which most species of 
ALEYRODES live through severe winters explains their comparative scarcity. In 
regard to the manner in which ALEYRODES pass the winters, Signoret in his Essai 
monographique sur les Aleurodes (Ann. soc. ent. France, 1868) says : "A n'importe 
quel &tat on les voit passer l'hiver : S. l'ftat parfait dam les anfractuosit& des arbres 
et des terres et meme sous les feuilles; S. l'ftat d'oeufs de larves ou de nymphes, 
sous les feuilles tombdes, sous les feuilles de plantes qui les conservent, telles que Ie 
fraisier, le chdlidoine, l'alaterne et les choux." 
My own observations would indicate that adult ALEYRODES do not hibernate ir~ 
this climate, although they are certainly able to stand a great amount of cold, The 
following extract from my notes on the strawberry Aleyrodes illustrates this last 
statement: "Nov. I I. A heavy frost last night as well as several preceding nights ; 
adults on strawberry leaves appeared benumbed but became active again soon after 
being brought into a warm room." 
The eggs of this species (A.pa;å´kardi deposited by the adults on the under 
surface of the leaves in the fall of 1901, began to hatch the following spring as 
early as March 23. From this time till April 14 many eggs hatched, but apparently 
all these larvae were killed by the frosts. Of the larvae that hatched later than 
April 14, few if any succumbed to the cold. The adults began to emerge from the 
pupa cases about the twentieth of May, previous to which time none were seen 
although a thorough search was made nearly every day. If the adults hibernated 
it is almost certain that they would have made their appearance before so late in 
the season. 




================================================================================


These observations lead to the conclusion that, for this species at least, our 
winters are so cold as to destroy all stages except the egg. 
If those species whose 
food plants are deciduous also pass the "winter in the egg stage, it would seem 
necessary, from our knowledge of the habits of the young larvae of ALEYRODES 
that the eggs be laid on or near the leaf buds, and even then the larvae would 
have but a slight chance of reaching maturity. 
On the other hand the multiplication of ALEYRODES seems to be favored by 
parthenogenesis. I have thus far discovered this method of reproduction only in 
A. vaporariorvm, but it probably occurs in many if not all other species of the genus. 
Correlated with this, I have found female ALEYRODES to be much more abundant 
than the males. Out of eighty-five adults taken at random, representing four 
different species, I found but twenty males to sixty-five females, and these figures 
probably represent about the usual proportion of the sexes in nature. 
In regard to the length of life of the adult, and the number of eggs laid by 
each female, I can only state that in one instance a female of A. vafo~u~iumrn lived 
in the adult condition twenty-five days, and laid a few more than forty-five eggs. 
I have here briefly considered only a few of the biological problems connected 
with this interesting group of insects. Very few observations have thus far been 
made in this direction and until the appearance of Quaintance's admirable paper, 
the group was much neglected systematically. During the summer of 1902 at 
Amherst, Mass., I found the five species of ALRYRODES mentioned below, but 
others - both known and unknown - undoubtedly occur in this region. It is the 
hope of the writer that this paper may lead to the recording of such by other work- 
ers in entomology. 
I. 
ALEYRODES MORI MACUT.AT4, SU~S~. nOV. 
PUPA CASE. 
Shiny black, elliptical; length, .7~-.76 mm,, width, 48-.j4 mm. 
A copious 
white cottony fi-iugc ail around, continuous proximally, but ragged distally. "On doi'sum 
of both mesothorax and metathorax near dorsi-meson is a pair of small brown setae; also a 
pair of setae near vasiform orifice and on caudal margin of case. . . . There is a pair of 
minute setae on the margin of case, one on each side near caudo-lateral region. On fourth 
abdominal segment on each side there is a group of from four to six minute pores. One or 
two pores are sometimes present on fifth segment on each side, just caudad of those on 
fourth."-Quaintance (A. won'). 
ADULT. Fore wings marked with red and brownish black. Body with conspicuous 
blackish markings as follows: a transverse band across front of head, between bases of 
antennae; a more or less distinct dark spot on each side just above the eye; a roundish black 
spot on each side of prothorax just below the dorsum; a more or less elliptical black spot 
covering a nearly equal area on each side of mesothorax, in front of and below the insertion 
of fore wings, -these last two pairs of spots together occupying a space on each side of the 
body about equal in size to one of the dumb-bell shaped compound eyes; an elongated spoton 
dorsum of mesothorax on each side in front of insertion of fore wing-these spots are 




================================================================================

oblique converging posteriorly; 
a smaller- spot on each side of dorsum of metathorax 
posteriorly; a transverse spot on dorsum of abdomen just anterior tovariform orifice; and a 
border along- the posterior margin of the opercnlum. In addition to these clearly defined 
markings, there may be slight tinges of black elsewhere, seen soon after emergence from 
pupa case but later hidden by the flour-like wax secretion. When mounted in balsam the 
thorax appears of a deep orange yellow color with brownish markings, and the abdomen 
pale yellow in color with brownish markings. 
In the Can. ent. vol. 31, p. 1-4, Professor Quaintance described A. morifrom 
Tampa, Fla., on mulberry, and from Lake City, Fla., on Tilia americana, Callicarfa 
americana, Liyuidamber styract'flt~a, Ilex @aca and less frequently on Persia caroli- 
nensis. The pupae and adults of A. mart macitlata agree with Professor Quaint- 
ance's description of A. mori except for the color of the bodies of the adults which 
in the latter is bright yellow. Hundreds of adults of the former have been bred 
and the blackish markings described above have been found to be constant. 
This subspecies seems to have a wide range of food plants and to be gener- 
ally distributed in this vicinity. It has been found on Comusflo~ida, C. sanguineus, 
ash, birch, and mulberry, but was not found on Tilia americana or Liquidamber 
styraciftua although these trees grew in the neighborhood of the species of Cornus 
upon whose leaves this insect was quite abundant. CORNUS seems to be the favor- 
ite food plant, although even on that plant rarely more than one half dozen pupae 
are found on a single leaf. 
Types of pupae and adults have been deposited at the Massachusetts agricul- 
tural college.

Abdominal segmentation distinct, thoracic segmentation less so. 
Margin crenulated, surrounded by a narrow fringe of wax. 
Three pairs of marginal spines : 
one pair on cephalic margin, very minute; one pair on caudo-lateral region, one on each 
side, very minute; a pair on caudal margin, about one tenth the length of the body. 
Vasiform orifice essentially as in pupa. 
Eyes small, color dark red. In the single specimen 
examined but one pair of dorsal spines was observed. 
These were on the cephalic region 
between the eyes. 
Aieyrodes fernaldi, 
Portion of margin of pupa. 
PUPA. Length, .7z-.S+ mm., greatest width, 
.44--54 mm. 
Form, subelliptical, slightly narrowed 
anteriorly; dorsal surface nearly flat; older speci- 
mens raised from surface of leaf by vertical wax 
fringe; margin fully crenulaled. Color when ".. 
freshly moulted, pale greenish white, operculum ,. 
tinged with yellowish ; older specimens except for 
a space of about one fourth the width of the body .- 
all around the margin covered with a white, thin, 
amorphons waxy secretion, giving to the pupae 
on a leaf a clear white appearance. Space between 
extreme margin and part covered by wax showing 
fine radiating striae and glistening structures which 
appear like rounded or conical protuberances. 
Across the middle of the dorsum, breaks in the 
waxy covering indicate the divisions between the 
body segments and in addition a median longitu- 
dinal break extends along the dorsnm from the 
Aleyrodes fenuildi, norsum of pupa. 
anterior edgc of body to the hase of abdomen. 
Wax covering or plate otherwise interrupted by rather large irregular openings through 
which circular pores in integument can be frequently seen; - i. e. one to each opening.

[April 
By dropping the pupa into xylol for a [ew minutes to cleaz and dissolve off the 
wax, and then mounting in xylol balsam, the surface structures can be plainly seen. 
A pair of short candal setae arise from minute papillae, barely within the caudal innrgin. 
A still smaller pair arise one on each side, a short distance from the first pair on caudo- 
lateral margin. Vasiform orifice subovate, one fourth longer than broad, indented poste- 
riorly. 
Corrugations or folds extend downward and inward horn sides of orifice. Oper- 
culum very broadly ovate, extendin- little more than one half the distance toward caudal 
end of orifice. Lingula spatulate, setose, bearing distally three distinct sidc lobes on each 
sidc and a single terminal lobe. All except, terminal lobe and posterior pak of side lobes 
covered by operculum. From each side of terminal lobe a rather stout seta arises extending 
candad nearly to apex of orifice. On cephalic region about one fifth of distance from ceph- 
alic to caudal margin is a pair of spines, one on each side of middle; on first abdominal 
segment a second pair, one on each side; and near vasiform orifice, opposite the widest 
part, a third pair of spines, one on each sidc. These three pairs of spines are all simple, 
minute, and of about equal size. Extreme margin irregularly radiately striated. 
A short 
distance mesad from margin is a row, all around, of small conical projections or thickenings 
and mesad to these, a row of minute knobbed setae. The structures of the inner row as a 
rule correspond in number and position to those of the outer row. Mesad to these two 
rows, body loses its striated appearance and is somewhat rugose. On each side of middle of 
dorsinn are the circular pores already mentioned. As a rule these never occur nearer the 
margin than a distance equal to one fifth width of body. There are about twenty-seven 
pairs of these, and almost invariably several unpaired ones also occur, particularly on 
cephalic region. Near each pore is a minute knobbed seta similar to those near margin of 
body. There are about fifteen or sixteen pores on cephalic region, those most anterior being 
usually unpaired; there are usually four pairs on mesothoracic region, four pairs on meta- 
. 
thoracic region, two pairs on first abdominal segnient, one pair on second, and two pairs 
each on the five following segments. On the under side of body the short and stout legs 
and antennae can be plainly seen. Antcnnae lie in pockets outside of first pair of legs, are 
stout, near the outer end abruptly narrowed, forming a slender tip. 
ADULT 9. Length I.-1.2 mm. Color, pale yellow, becoming covered with white flour- 
like substance a short time after e~ncrgingfrom pupa case. Rostrum usually tipped with 
black. Wings immaculate, about 1.1 nun. long, and .48 mm. broad, with a single 
unbranched median vein ; on margin are globular beads which beat- on outer side several 
minute setae. Eyes divided into two parts; color, dark red. Legs and antennae of 
specimens mounted in xylol balsam nearly colorless. Segments of antennae show following 
proportions with eyepiece-micrometer, one-inch eyepiece, and one-half-inch obj. : 2-5-11-3- 
4i-4-3 t 
ADULT 8. Length .9 mm. 
Proportionally smaller than 9, otherwise differing only 
in sexual organs. 
This is a common species in this locality ('Amherst, Mass.), occurring abun- 
dantly on several species of Spiraea. I have also found it though less frequently 
on strawberry with Alqwades packad. 
I take pleasure in naming ihis insect for Prof C. H. Fernald who first called 
my attention to its occurrence on Spiraea growing on the college grounds.

Encarsia, without much doubt the male of Encarsia htteola Howard; but as htteola 
was described from a female it was impossible to give the specific determination 
positively.

PSYCHE [June. 
Body and appendages covered with sparse and rather long, suberect, yellow hairs. 
Reddish yellow throughout except the mandibles, cljpeus, and anterior border of the 
head which are more brownish. 
Described from nine specimens taken at Austin, Tex., May 25, 1901 ; the 
only occasion on which I have seen this species. 
The insects were moving along 
under a stone in a small troop, all the members of which were very nearly of the 
same diminutive size. The species is evidently hypogaeic in its habits like E. 
coecz~m, nitens, co~zmz~tatum, elc. 
It may be distinguished from all our North American Ecitons by its very small 
size, and from the species above mentioned by its very long, narrow head and the 
prominent, rather acute basal tooth of the mandibles. Mexican specimens which 
I assign to E. cornmutaturn Emery have the tooth broad and blunt and the head 
is fully two thirds as broad as long. 
2. PONERA INEXORATA, sp. nov. 
WOYA~Y. Length z.'Jj-T,.Zs mm. 
Mandibles long and flattened, with concavely sinuate lateral borders and about a dozen 
teeth, which are small and indistinct towards the base, but longer and more pointed towards 
the tip of the blade. Head distinctly longer than broad with concave occipital margin and 
subparallel sides. Clypeus broadly rounded in front, convex in the middle. Antennae 
rather slender, scape reaching to the posterior angle of the head, 
joints 2-,$ of the funiculns fully as long as broad, the remaining 
joints longer than broad. Eyes very small, with at most 3-4 
ommatidia in their longest diameter and situated about one 
fourth the distance from the anterior to the posterior border of 
the head. Thorax with very distinct promeso-notal and meso- 
epinotal sutures; pronotum broader than the succeeding tho- 
racic segments, rounded, with rather sloping anterior angles ; 
niesonotnm convex; epinotum laterally compressed, its basal 
portion in profile horizontal and nearly straight, its declivity 
flattened, with rounded sides, not carinate. Petiole decidedly 
narrower than the first srastric segment. its anterior surface

posterior surface flat in both directions, so that the segment 
when seen from above is somewhat, semi-circular; seen from 
behind the border of the node is nearly circular in outline. 
Gaster of the usual form. 
Legs 
moderately stout, each tibia with a pair of spurs, one of which is pectinated. 
Surface of the body, especially the dorsal surface of the head, thorax, and petiole, shining. 
Mandibles with coarse, scattered, piligerous punctures.

metaplenrae similarly but more coarsely sculptured, subopaque. 
Petiole and gasier covered 
with piligerous punctures like those on the pronotum. 
Whole body clothed with pale yellow, reclinate or appressed hairs, among which there 
are longer, more scattered, snberect hairs, especially on the thorax and abdomen. 
Yellowish ferruginous throughout, mandibles, antennae, and legs somewhat paler. 
Epinotum, mesopleurae, and posterior gastric segments sometimes more reddish or brown- 
ish. Teeth of mandibles and anterior border of clypeus blackish. 
Female (deulated). Length 3.25 mm, 
Very much like the worker in form and coloration. 
Each ocellus with a small black 
spot at its margin. 
Head distinctly more opaque than in the worker, owing to a denser 
aggregation of the piligerous fovcolac; the node is thinner antero-posteriorly and its ante- 
rior surface is very flat or even slightly concave from side to side. 
Alar insertions black. 
Described from two females and numerous workers taken at Austin, San 
Angelo, and Fort Davis. The species is not common. 
It occurs in colonies not 
exceeding a dozen individuals and usually much smaller. 
I have found it only on 
dry hill-slopes under rather small stones (limestone in central Texas, volcanic rock 
in the Trans-Pecos). 
P. inexoyata is closely related to P. dislinguenda. Emery of Venezuela, Brazil, 
and Paraguay, but is smaller and yellowish ferruginous in color instead of fuscous. 
3. PHEIDOLE TITANIS, sp. nov. 
Soldier. Length 7.25-8 mm. 
Head proportionally small, hardly larger 
than the gaster, a little longer than broad, 
excluding the mandibles, subcordate, somewhat 
broader behind than in front, with prominent 
rounded posterior corners ; posterior border 
deeply excised in the middle. A deep groove 
extendsfrom this excision to the frontal area. 
Mandibles robust, convex, with flattened, edentu- 
ous, and nearly straight blades which terminate 
in two prominent apical teeth. Clypeus short, 
its anterior border deeply excised in the middle, 
feebly and sinuately concave on either side; 
median surface rather flat and depressed. Fron- 
tal area triangular, as long- as wide. Frontal 
crinae long. diverging, continued hackward F,~;, 3. phtiidotei^m;s, *,. ,.ov. 1jerd ,,i snidse,.

very sniall, scape distinctly flattened but hardly incrassated. reaching only to a little beyond 
the posterior orbit ; fuuiculus slender, its joints all decidedly longer than broad, club very 
short and indistinctly marked off from the remainder of the funiculus. 
Eyes moderate, 
round, at about one third the distance from the anterior to the posterior border of the head.

pronounced striae on the outer biisal margin. Clypeiis shining in the middle, more opaque 
at the sides which are coarsely longitudinally rugose. There is a prominent median ruga. 
Frontal area shining, with a median carinula. Head subopaquc covered with rather coarse, 
parallel, longitudinal rugac over the anterior three quarters, posterior fourth smooth and 
shining, with a few scattered and shallow fovcolae. Spaces between the rngae filled with 
minor reticulations which extend back somewhat beyond the ends of the main rugae on to 
the smooth occipital surface. Thorax subopaque, pro- and mesonotum more shining, 
pronotum and sides of mesonotum with several sharp transverse rngae. Mesopleurae and 
whole epinotum coarsely punctate rngulose. Petiole and postpetiole opaque, punctate 
rugulose throughout. Gaster hardly shining, as its surface is finely reticulate and irregularly 
and rather densely punctate ; only the basal portions of the segments where they are over- 
lapped by preceding segments when the gaster is not distended, arc smooth and shining. 
Antennae and legs smooth and shining, scape, tibiae, and femora with scattered piligernus 
punctures. 
Whole insect covered with rather long, coarse, yellow hairs, which are erect or suberect 
on the body. antenna1 scapc, and legs, but shorter and less conspicuous on the f~iniculus and 
tarsi. 
Rich ferruginous red, thorax and petiole somewhat darker, edges of mandibular blades, 
anterior border of clypens, epinotal spines and gasier black, the posterior edges of the gastric 
segments yellowish, the basal half of the first gastric segment sometimes ferruginous. 
Worker. Length 4-4.5 mm. 
Head, exclnding the mandibles, as broad as long; posterior angles rounded. 
findibles 
with two prominent apical teeth and the remainder of thcir blades finely crenulate. 
Clypeus 
short, its anterior border straight, faintly and sinuately excised in 
the middle, posterior 
median surface strongly convex. Frontal area triangular, rather indistinct. Antennae 
slender, scape slightly thickened distally, extending beyond the posterior corner of the head 
to a distance about one third of its length; funiculus with all its joints distinctly longer 
than broad, joints 2-7 subequal, fully twice as long as broad; club appearing+-jointed as 
the 8111 joint forms a transition between the basal and terminal joints. Thorax much like 
that of the soldier, but with less robust and narrower prothorax ; epinotal spines more 
slender, straight and pointed. Petiole slcndcr, more than twice as long as hroad, node 
rounded, hardly transverse. Postpetiole as long as broad, campanulate, nearly twice as 
broad as the petiole. Gaster and legs 'of the usual shape.

frontal carinae. 
Mesopleurae, epinotum, ventral and lateral surfaces of the petiole and 
postpetiole subopaque, reticulate punctate. 
Pilosity similar to that of the soldier but less abundant. 
Black or very dark reddish brown. 
Mandibles, anterior portion of head, pro- and 
mesopleurae reddish yellow. 
Antennae and legs reddish yellow, scape and femora darker. 
Described from numerous specimens taken in the Paisano Pass, Brewster 
County, by myself, and in the Chisos Mts. by Judge 0. W. Williams. 
The single 
nest found in the Paisano Pass was between huge immovable boulders embedded 
in the soil, so that I could secure only the workers, but Judge Williams obtained 
great numbers both of the soldiers and workers from a large nest under a stone 
near the foot of the Chisos. 
Ph. titanis differs from all the other species of PEEIDOLE known to occur in 
the United States in its great size. It belongs to the group of species comprising 
Ph. hyatti Emery and Ph. crassicornis Emery. The soldier of Ph. titanis resembles 
the soldiers of both of these species in the relatively small size and sculpturing 
of the head, and the flattened antennal scape, but differs in the peculiar, short, and 
indistinct antennal club and the deep median excision of the anterior clypeal border. 
4. PHEIDOLE TEXANA, sp. nov. 
Soldier. Length 4-5 mm. 
Head rather small, but larger than the gaster, a little longer than broad, excluding the 
mandibles, cordiform, distinctly broader behind than in front, with deeply excised posterior 
border, rounded posterior angles, and a rather broad median furrow extending from the 
frontal area to the occiput. Frontal area triangular, 
about as broad as long. Clypeus short, its anterior 
border flattened and rather deeply notched in the middle. 
Frontal carinae short, prominent. Eyes moderate, "well 
in front of the middle of the sides of the head. Mandi- 
bles large, convex with flattened blades, which are finely 
denticulate basally, with two prominent terminal teeth. 
Antenna1 scape broadened and flattened, distinctly con- 
cave on its anterior surface, hardly reaching to half the 
distance between the eye and the posterior corner of the 
head, funiculus with all its joints longer than broad, the 
last three joints forming a well-developed club. Thorax 
not very robust, pronotal angles rounded, pronotum rather

thcir bases and much farther apart than loug, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards. 
Petiole in profile with long concave ascending nodal surface and convex ventral surface; 
the node is acute, transverse, with median emargination and short, concave posterior 
declivity; seen from above the petiole is small, not more than one and a half times as long 
as broad, broader behind than in front, constricted in the middle, with rather acute posterior 
angles. Postpetiole three times as broad as the petiole and more than twice as broad as 
long, with a small, acute projection in the middle on either side; in profile the dorsal surface 
is evenly convex and longer than the more uneven ventral surface. Gaster rather large, 
elliptical, flattened on its dorsal surface. Legs of moderate length and of the usual 
conformation. 
Mandibles shining-, indistinctly reticulate, covered with large piligerous punctures. 
Clypeus shining in the middle, faintly reticulate like the mandibles, on either side with a 
few coarse longitudinal rugae. Frontal area impressed, shining, with a few longitudinal 
rugae on either side. Head opaque throughout, covered with coarse reticulate rugae enclos- 
ing more finely reticulateiuterrugal spaces; the main rugae with distinctly longitudinal 
trend only on the front and cheeks. Cephalic furrow crossed by numerous transverse rugae 
especially towards the occipital border. 
Antenna1 scape shining, fincly reticulate. Thorax, 
petiole, and postpetiole opaque like the head, but mow finely reticulate rugose; only the dor- 
sal surfaces are roughened, the pro- and meso~~ot~irn being crossed by afew coarse and irreg 
ular transverse rugae. Postpetiole with about eight shallow longitudinal impressions on its 
dorsal surface. Gaster and legs shining, their surfaces finely and regularly reticulate. 
Body and appendages invested with rather long, more or less erect, tawny hairs. 
Rich ferruginous red throughout; legs and antennae but little paler than the body; gas- 
ter somewhat infuscated posteriorly, anteriorly pellucid and in man\- specimens appearing 
as if filled with a wine-red fluid so that this region has a more brilliant color than the 
remainder of the body. 
Worker. Length 2.5-3. mm. 
Head but little longer than broad, its posterior border rather straight but not concave. 
Mandibles rather slender, 8-toothed, the first, second, and fourth teeth from the apex being 
longer than the others. Clypeus sinuately ernarginate in the middle, with a 'median and 
on either side two lateral longitudinal ridges or carinulae. Frontal area triangular, as long 
as broad, with a median longitudinal ridge. Anteunal scapes not flattened, distinctly enlarged 
at their distal ends; exceeding the posterior angles of the head by somewhat more than 
twice thcir transverse diameter. PI-onotum rounded above and on the sides, spheroidal ; 
mesonotu~n projecting upwards as a transverse ridge which is not concave in the middle 
when seen from behind, separated by distinct constrictions from the pro- and epinotum. 
The latter shaped like that of the soldier. Petiole slender, fully twice as long as broad, in 
other respects like the corresponding segment of the. soldier. Postpetiole nearly three times 
as broad as the petiole, hardly twice as broad a& long, its sides and dorsal surface rounded, 
thc angles of the former being very indistinct. 
Sculpti-11-e like that of the soldicr but feebler, especially on the head. 
Pilosity and color, 
too, as in the soldicr, except that there is a large black spot on the vertex in many speci- 
inens. 
Described from numerous soldiers and workers. These were taken from four 
nests, the only ones I have seen during as many years. 
They were all situated in

different parts of Travis County, Texas, in open, sunny grass-lands. Each nest 
was surmounted by a regular moundlet about four inches in diameter and consist- 
ing of coarse pellets of earth. The ants are very pugnacious but their stings are 
feebly developed. 
Ph. texmu, like the preceding species, belongs to the group comprising Ph. 
hyatt' and Pit. trassicornis, on account of the flattening of the antennal scape in the 
soldier, the relatively small head, etc. Ph. texana, however, is readily distinguished 
by the coarse reticulation covering the whole head and leaving no polished poste- 
rior angles, and by the antennal scape which is intermediate in length between that 
of Ph. hyatti and Ph. crassicornis. 
5. MACROMISCHA SUBDITIVA, sp. nov. 
Worker, Length 2-2.5 mm. 
Head somewhat longer than broad, rounded at the posterior angles and convex above. 
Mandibles rather small, with three acute apical and three much smaller basal teeth. 
Cly- 
peus short, broadly rounded in front, convex in the middle, with a prominent median carina 
running its full length and continued over the frontal area. Frontal area large, triangular, 
longer than broad. Antennae long, 12-jointed; scape extending beyond the posterior corner 
of the head to a distance equal to twice its breadth; first funicular joint nearly as long as the 
three succeeding joints together, joints 2-8 about as long as broad, two penultimate joints sub- 
equal, together as long as the terminal joint. Thorax short and thick-set, dorsum in profile 
convex, evenly rounded : pi-othorax 
with broadly rounded angles, pro- 
mesonotal suture very faintly, meso- 
Epinotal suture somewhat more dis- 
tinctly indicated. Epinotuin armed 
with two stout, spines, which are very 
close together at their bases but 
diverge strongly outward, upward, 
and backward; epinotal declivity con- 
cave. Petiole long, with a conspicn- 
onsly elongated peduncle which passes

very abruptly into the transverse 
node; the tatter is much compressed anter~-~o&teriorl~ when seen in profile, the anterior 
and posterior surfaces being flattened and perpendicular, the summit of the node narrow 
and rounded; when seen from behind, the edge of the node is horizontal and nearly straight. 
There is a small but distinct tooth on the ventral surface of the petiole near its anterior end. 
Postpetiole from above but little wider than the node of the petiole, fully twice as broad as 
long, rounded oblong; in profile it is nodiform, very convex dorsally, in both views showing 
a decided constriction at its insertion into the gaslei-. 
Gaster of the usual shape, with it 
long, powerful sting. Legs of the usual shape, with the femora conspicuously incrassated 
in the middle. 
There are no spurs on the middle and hind tibiae.

TOO PSYCHE [June 
Head, including the mandibles and clypeus, subopaque, sharply longitudinally rugose; 
the rugae connected by subsidiary reticulate rugae on the base of the rnandibles,cheeks, and 
sides of the head. 
Ciyeus and frontal area more shining, the former -with few rugae, 
especially near the middle. 
Thoracic dorsum shining, pleurae and epinotnm subopaque. 
Whole surface of thorax reticulate rugose, regularly in the opaque regions, more irregularly 
and more longitudinally on the shining dorsal surface. Petiole and postpetiole shining 
above, reticulate and subopaque on the ventral and lateral surfaces. Gaster very smooth and 
shining. Legs more opaque, finely but distinctly reticulate. 
Head, thorax, and abdomen beset with sparse, erect, obtuse, silvery white hairs; antennae 
and legs with minute, appressed, pointed hairs of the same color. 
Body black or, in immature specimens, very dark brown ; niandibles, antennae, legs and 
epinotal spines, tip of gaster, and sting yellow, scape and club of antennae- bases of epi- 
natal, spines, and greater portion of femora and tibiae infnscated. 
A rare species described from a few specimens taken along Walnut Creek, 
near Austin (May 12, 1901): and at New Braunfels (June 3, 1901). 
In the former 
locality they were found walking on the leaves of bushes, in the latter on a dead 
limb lying on the ground. I did not succeed in finding the nest which is probably 
small and not very populou~.~ 
This is the first species of MACROMISCHA to be described from the United 
States, and I am not altogether sure that it is to be assigned to this neotropical genus. 
It certainly resembles some of our species of LEPTOTHORAX with I 2-jointed antennae, 
like L. obturator Wheeler. Emery maintains that MACROMISCHA differs from the 
other 
myrmicine genera in the following characters: I. the petiole has a long 
peduncle ; 2. the postpetiole is campanulate and attached by its whole breadth to 
the first gastric segment; 3. the thoracic dorsum is continuous, i. e., without sutures 
or constrictions; and 4. there are no spurs on the middle and hind tibiae. M suli- 
ditiva does not present the second and third of these characters, but it certainly 
differs from our species of LEPTOTHORAX in the remarkable shape of the petiole. 
Worker. Length 3-3.7.5 inna. 
Mandibles long, pointed, 7-8 toothed. 
Clypeus short, with a deep excision in the mid- 
dle of its anterior border. Head with pointed posterior angles, deeply excised occipital 
margin and rather straight, subparallel sides. Frontal carinae large, suboblong, conspic- 
uously concave on their upper surfaces, and continued back to the posterior angles of the 
head as prominent crenated ridges, on either side hounding a marked concavity for the recep-

tion of the antennal scape whenfolded back. 
Just behind the posterior angle of the head 
there is a prominent projection. 
Antenna1 scape robust, hardly extending beyond the poste- 
rior corner of the head; funicnlus long, its joints all distinctly longer than broad. 
Pro- 
and mesonotum high, arched dorsally above the epinotum which is separated by a deep con- 
striction from the inesonoinm and has its basal surface of aboul the same length as its abrupt 
and somewhat concave declivity. 
Sides of mesonotum carinate. 
The thorax is armed with 
the following prominent spines and protuberances: prouotum with two spines on either side 
and a double tubercle in the mid-dorsal line : ~nesonotum with a large blunt tubercle at either 
anterior corner and farther hack a pair of smaller spine-like tubercles which are much closer 
together than the anterior pair; epinotum with 
a pair of prominent spines. the bases of which 
are continued forward as ridges bordering the 
basal dorsal surface of the epinotum. These 
spines are longer than their distance apart at 
their bases, and are directed outwards, back- 
wards, and upwards. Petiole in profile de- 
pressed, the pedicel rising gradually into the 
somewhat rounded node, sides subcarinate, 
ventral surface with a small acute tooth at the 
extreme anterior end; seen from above the 
node is oblong, distinctly longer than broad. 
Postpetiole nearly twice as broad as long, its 
anterior border rounded, its posterior border 
straight, with a large depression in the mid- 
dorsal line ; the sides are distinctly carinate. 
Gaster somewhat obione when seen from above, 
slightly flattened ; in profile more pyriform, 
sides faintly carinate. Legs of the usual 
conformation. 
Mandibles subopaque, finely striated, the 
edges of the blades with a row of shallow, 
elongate depressions. Body, legs, and antenna1 
scapc opaque, roughened, covered with small 
tubercles, which are more or less connected by 
low confluent ridges on the head and thorax.

Wings fully j mm. Iong; extending far beyond 
the tip of the gaster, yellowish white, opaque, like ground glass; veins brownish, insertions

I have taken this new fungus-growing ant in the following localities in Texas : 
Fort Stockton, Pucos County ; 
Del Rio, and Langtry, Valverde County ; Marfa, 
Presidio County; Marble Falls, Burnet County and in many places in the vicinity 
of Austin, Travis County. 
It is nowhere very abundant and is easily overlooked 
on account of its extremely retiring disposition. Its nests and mushroom gardens, 
which I hope to describe at length in another place, are similar to those of Atta 
septentrionalls McCook. The entrance to the nest is very often surmounted by a 
peculiar turret, sometimes 1% inches high and built of little twigs, leaves, etc. 
Atfa turr'fex is a well-marked species. 
The worker differs from the worker 
of A. septent~ionalis and the Mexican A. saussurei Forel in the following characters : 
The antenna1 scape is much shorter, hardly reaching beyond the posterior angle of. 
the head, the lobes of the frontal carinae are broader and more concave, the poste- 
rior angles of the head are more acute, the sides of the head are straight and not 
rounded. The spines on the pro- and mesonotum are longer -and of a different 
conformation, the postpetiole is conspicuously shorter, the general color of the body 
is darker, and there is no dorsal black band on the gaster. The characters of the 
head alone, as shown in the accompanying camera sketches of A. twrifex and A. 
septentrionalis, will suffice to separate the species at a glance. There are corre- 
sponding differences between the females of the two species. 
As I have at last discovered A. septentrionalis in Texas (at Milano and Den- 
ton), it is clear that Buckley's name A. tard>grada, usually applied to this species, 
should be given up, since there is no way of deciding to which of the two species, 
his very inadequate description refers.

Described from one male and a dozen workers 
taken under stones in a rather 
dry open place at Austin, May 25, 1901. The species is certainly rare in central 
Texas. 
23. nunellus is closely related to B. heerii Forel subsp. depilis Emery, the only 
other member of the genus known to occur in the United States. The worker 
?zaneZh~s is distinguished by its much smaller size (B. heerii dep1Zis measures 1.5-2 
mm.), the shorter funicular joints and maxillary palpi, and the much paler color 
(depilis is distinctly brown). The male is also much paler in color than the male 
of depilis. It is possible that nunellus may have to be reduced to the rank of a 
subspecies of heerii, when the various species of the extremely difficult American 
genus BRACIIYMYRMEX are subjected to a careful comparative study.

106 PSYCHE [June 
The species, which I take pleasure in dedicating to my former pupil, Mr. A. 
L. Melander, is very common in central and Trans-Pecos Texas, where it occurs 
under stones, visually in rather damp localities but not infrequently also on the 
sun-scorched limestone hills at an altitude of 1000-5000 ft. Its colonies are seen 
most frequently during the moister seasons of the year and like the colonies of 
most of our Texan Camponoti contain males and winged females during the winter 
and early spring months (January to April 1st). 
P. melanderi can be readily distinguished from P. pwla Mayr in having 
prominent hairs on the antennal scape in the worker, and in the male by the 
characteristic genital appendages which are very unlike those of the male parvula. 
The species above described 
may be identical with the form described by 
Buckley as Formica ferricda, but as this cannot be proved with certainty, since he 
would be a bold man who would pretend to recognize a particular species of so 
difficult a genus as PRENOLEPIS among the descriptions of that author, I have 
decided to reject Buckley's name and redescribe the species.

The long erect hairs are distributed as in the worker, but are shorter and less conspicuous. 
On the outer genital appendages there are numerous erect hairs, which, however, are less 
robust and shorter than the hairs on the gastric segments, 
Head, thorax, and abdomen deep black as are also the mandibular teeth, and the femora 
and tibiae except the articulations which are yellow. Mandibles, sides of clypeus, and tarsi 
yellow. Antennae and genital valves more or less infuscated. Wings grayish hyaline with 
gray nervnres, more indistinct than in the female. 
This species which I dedicate to my former pupil, Mr. C. T. Brucs, is 
described from numerous males, females, and workers which I collected Dec. ~gth, 
1901, in Fresno Canon, in the southern part of Presidio County, Texas. The 
nests, more extensive and populous than those of P. melanderi, were found under 
piles of stones, just above high water mark wliere the soil retains some moisture 
during the dry season. P. bruesii is sufficiently distinct from all the described 
American PRENOLEPIS on account of the peculiar configuration of the male genital 
appendages.

At the time of writing my paper on the Diptera of 
Florida (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1895, p. 303-304) I did not possess examples 
of Say's species, and as Wiedemann's species agrees quite closely in color-pattern 
I assumed that the synonymy was correct. Since obtaining specimens of C. 
cruciatus I was somewhat surprised to find a great difference in the antennae, so 
much so that D. curnutus cannot remain in the genus Ceraturgus. The antennae 
are so accurately described by Wiedemann, as to leave no doubt as to the species: 
"Erstes Fihlerglied rijthlich, die tolgenden schwarz: erstes und zweites von

The terminal joint has a slight lobe-like projection bearing a small spine as 
shown in Fig. 3. In C. cruciatus the terminal joint is elongated and densely 
pubescent (Fig. 2). The rare Ceraturgus aurulentus Fabr., also resembles C. 
cornntus, but the form of the antennae (Fig. I), hyaline wings, and smaller size 
readily separates it from that species. I have seen but three specimens of C.

The specimen ( 9 ) on which this species is based was collected by Mr. G. R. 
Pilate at Tifton, Georgia, Sept. 9, 1896, and was received from Dr. Garry de N. 
Hough. I had placed it doubtfully with that variable species, D, frisfis Walk. 
(D. tidnctus Loew.). After carefully comparing it with eleven specimens of 
that species in my collection from St. Augustine, Ha., and Opelousas, La.,collected 
in June, I submitted the specimen to Mr. D. W. Coquillett who also considered it 
distinct from D. tristis. 
This species is distinguished from D, tristis in having the thorax noticeably 
narrower ; the third joint of the antennae (Fig. 5) shorter, proportionately broader 
and entirely red ; the rnystax finer less profuse and whitish, not red ; abdominal 
segments one to five each bearing a broad basal band of yellow, those on the second 
and third occupying the entire lateral margin and gradually narrowing towards the 
dorsum, segments five to eight bright red, not black; wings decidedly narrower, 
brown, with the discal portions and margin of the veins yellowish. Length 16 mm. 
It should also be noted that the great difference between the two species in 
their time of appearing, also shows that they are in no way related, as all data 
pertaining to the Asilidae indicate but one seasonal brood.

SAROPOGON BICOLOR, sp. nov. 
8. 
Head black, mystax and pubescence of the face yellow, antennae reddish, becoming 
dark brown towards the tip; proboscis black, slightly brownish at the base. Thorax black, 
with a large quadrate humeral spot from which extends a lateral line of the same color to the 
base of the scutellum, minute pustules, bearing short hairs give the entire body a punctated 
appearance ; pleurae and scutellum black, lateial angles of the scutellum and metanotum 
brownish, pleurae shining. First and seventh segments of the abdomen black, the others 
red, "with a lateral margin of black, the second segment has a narrow conlinuous posterior 
margin of black, on the others it extends but a slight distance from the lateral margin; 
venter black. Halters and legs reddish, coxae, tips of the posterior femora and base of the 
tibiae, with a very narrow ring of black, the last joint of the front and middle tarsi also 
black, spines on the tibiae few in numbers and mostly white, those on the tarsi numerous 
and black. Wings with a light brownish tinge, the veins on the basal half bright yellow ; 
the fourth posterior cell closed and slightly petiolate. 
Length 12 mm. 
One specimen said to have been taken near San Antonio, Texas, was given to 
me by the late Andrew Bolter. 
. 
Similar in form to the preceding but the entire body, legs and antennae are a deep 
black, with the same punctated appearance; mystax for the most part black. 
Halteres 
yellow. 
Wings brown, the veins black, fourth posterior cell narrowly open. 
Length 12 
mm. 
Obtained with the preceding specimen and may prove to be only a variety, 
but with so limited material I am not justified in uniting them. 
The difference in 
the fourth posterior cell cannot be relied on even as a specific character, as it varies 
even in the same species. Among the four specimens of A adustiis in my collec- 
tion, two have it closed and slightly petiolate, while in the other two it is narrowly 
open. 
The same variation exisis in S. combustus ; nor is it scxual. 
Near San Antonio, Texas. 
ATOMOSIA SAYII, sp. nov. 
This name is applied to the variety referred to by Say under ('Laphria gla- 
Jyata" as "Var. a. 
Feet pale " (Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 111, 54, 1823.) 
It is very evident that Say had two species before him, and that the name and 
description can only apply to the one with-('feet reddish brown, the middle of the

thighs, tips of the tibia and tarsi darker." 
The markings on the femora really 
consists of a large patch of black occupying the greater portion of the nppcr side of 
the front and middle femora, and the upper side of the outer half of the posterior 
femora. The only specimens in my collection were taken in Fairmount Park, 
Philadelphia, Aug. 4, 1892, and Castle Rock, Delaware Co., Pa., Aug., I I, 1901 
(E. Daecke) Atomosia rufipes Macquart is undoubtedly a synonym. 
In A. /z;e/Za Wied. the legs are black except a narrow ring of yellow at (he base 
of the femora, and tibiae ; antennae entirely black. The species is widely distributed, 
appearing in the Cult States in May, and in the vicinity of Philadelphia late in June 
or early in July. A. pzisiZZa Macq. can also be added to the synonymy. 
In A. sqzi the legs are pale yellow, with a minute spot at the base of the 
posterior femora, terminal joint of the tarsi, and claws blackish; the third joint 
of the antennae are noticeably longer than in either A. glatrata or A. /uelZa ; the 
second joint being brown. In its habits A. suyii differs considerably from the 
others. On July 23, 1893, at Folsom Delaware Co., Pa., I captured over 75 speci- 
mens of both sexes, and invariably on the leaves and terminal shoots of plants; 
while A. pzd~a and A. glabrata are as a rule found on stumps, logs, or the trunks 
of trees. 
Its distribution is similar to A. &ella, but appearing somewhat later: 
Opelousas, La., June (Pilate) ; in the vicinity of Philadelphia, July 23 to 31. 
Atomosia sayor, Bigot from Lower California, resembles A. sayii in having pale 
yellow legs ; but is distinguished by the lighter colored antennae, the more abun- 
dant, prostrate, yellow hairs on the thorax and abdomen, and red post-alar 
protuberance.

MORSE : - flE W 
OR THOPTERA FROM NE VADA 
NEW ORTHOPTERA FROM NEVADA. 
BY ALBERT P. MORSE, WELLESLEY, MASS. 
Among a small lot of Orthoptera collected in Nevada by Mr. C. F, Baker I 
find four new species, as follows : - 
CORDILLACRIS AFFINIS, Sp. nOV. 
One male, five females, Ormsby Co., Nev., July 6. 
These specimens agree in 
size, general form, proportions, and markings with C. occipltalis, but differ as fol- 
lows : the front margin of the scutellum of the vertex is farther removed from the 
apex and external margin of the vertex, being nearer a line drawn at the level of 
the front margin of the eyes than to the apex of the vertex- in occipitalis the 
reverse is true,- and the fuscous stripe on the dorsal part of the outer face of the 
hind femora is broken up into narrow transverse fasciae. The name CORDILLACR~S 
has been proposed by Rehn (Can. ent., vol. 33, p. 271) to replace ALPHA (Brunner 
Rev. syst. orth., p. 121, 1893) which is preoccupied in Hymenoptera. 
STENOBOTHRUS ACIJTUS, sp. nov. 
Five males, Ormsby Co., Nev., July 6. Closely allied to St. a1rt1.pemis but 
differing in having the vertex more produced and the angle of its sides more acute; 
the facial costa is also wider and scarcely or not at all narrowed opposite the 
median ocelIus. The lateral foveolae are deep and very distinct, and the antennae 
average shorter (in the specimens seen). Possibly it is but a geographical race 
but in either case it seems worthy of a name. 
Antenna : 8.5-9.5 ; hind fern. : 11-12 ; tegmina: 10-12 ; tola]. length: 16- 
17.5 mm, The tegmina equal the abdomen. 
HTCSPEROTETTIX NEVADENSTS, sp. nov. 
Three males, three females, Ormsby Co., Nev., July 6, Very similar to 
JI. brevifemir, the female somewhat smaller, differing in ornamentation and 
slightly in structure, the vertex being a very little narrower between the eyes, 
and the tegmina relatively shorter, especially in the male. The tegmina in both 
sexes are about one and one third times as long as the exposed portion of the 
abdomen (in brez~+ennis nearly or quite covering- abdomen, particularly in male). 
General color pea-green, ranging (in male at least) to rusty brown, and varied with 
pale yellow stripes on mid-carina and on anterior portion of lateral carinae of pro- 
notum, on rneso- and metaplkura, lower margin of genae, lower margin of outer 
face of hind femora, and on the veins of the teginina especially the posterior ulnar. 
Hind femora with ferruginous annulus above knee, in brown male showing indica- 
tions of two obliquely transverse fuscous fasciae. Hind tibiae bluish green, paler

Four males, four females, Ormsby Co., Nev., July 6. 
Nearly allied to B. obesa, differing from that species in its smaller size, the 
structure of the pronotum, the less upturned end of the abdomen, and in the form 
of the supra-anal plate of the male. In obesa this plate is as wide as long, in corn- 
pa& it is distinctly longer than wide. 
The lateral carinae of the pronotum are 
equally as distinct or even better developed than in obesa and less irregular in

PSYCHE 
STUDIES FOR STUDENTS.- 111. ELEMENTARY STUDIES IN 
INSECT HISTOLOGY. 
BY VERNON L. KELLOGG, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA. 
For the study of the anatomy, or histology, of insect tissues, the laboratory or 
working loom must have a certain minimum of equipment and the student a cer- 
tain elementary tiaining in histologic method or technic. By the technic of insect 
histology is meant the particular methods of killing, fixing, hardening, clearing, 
infiltrating and imbedding, sectioning, staining, and mounting, so that the various 
body tissues may be available for examination and study under considerable micro- 
scopic magnification. With the methods of manipulation acquired by instruction 
and experience, the actual study of the histologic characteristics of the various 
particular tissues and organs of the insect body can be undertaken. The tissues 
should be studied first, for almost any organ comprises in its intimate make-up 
several distinct tissues or kinds of cellular aggregates. In this paper 1 purpose 
giving, first, a brief account of a generally applicable course of procedure in prepar- 
ing insect tissues for histologic study, and then a series of brief directions and 
hint.. for the recognition and study of the various typical or normal insect tissues, 
and finally similar directions and suggestions for the study of the fine anatomy of 
the principal insect body-organs. 
As in Studies I (PSYCHE, vol. 9, p. 207) on insect anatomy and Studies I1 
[hc. at., p. 246) on the development of the histoblasts of wings and legs, the giant 
crane-fly HuZurusia rubighosa was used for specific subject, the same insect species 
will be used as principal subject of this paper. But it is plain, that the similar 
study of any other insect may be based on the study here outlined of this particu- 
lar one. 
HISTOLOGIC TECHNIC. 
Killing and fixing:.- The chitinized cuticula of the 
insect body is nearly impervious, to fixing fluids, so that for quick killing and fixing 
of the tissues, heat is, in most cases, the best killing agent. Tissues that have 
been dissected out from the body of a live (chloroformed) specimen may be fixed 
without heat in any of the usual fluids. To kill and fix the whole body of insects, 
drop specimens alive into boiling water; leave them in this but a moment or two, 
i. e., until the body is rigid, then transfer to 30% alcohol. While here puncture 
the body wall with a needle, scalpel, or fine scissors in several places, not cutting 
deeply nor making the wound in the dorm-ventral median longitudinal plane of 
the body. Leave in 30% alcohol three hours; then transfer to 50% alcohol for 
three hours, then to 7 j % alcohol for from six to twelve hours, then to 85 % alcohol 




================================================================================


19031 KELLOGG: -STUDIES FOR STUDENTS 119 
in which the specimens may be preserved indefinitely. Or, transfer the specimens 
from the boiling water to a warm concentrated solution of corrosive sublin~ate in 
35% alcohol for three hours (puncturing the body wall just before removing to this 
solution) ; then wash in 75% alcohol; then transfer to 75% alcohol to which a few 
drops of tincture of iodine has been added, to extract the corrosive sublimate, then 
wash in clear 75% alcohol and transfer to 85% alcohol for keeping. Do not use 
metal instruments in handling material fixed in corrosive sublimate. Put specimens 
in at least ten times their own bulk of the various solutions used. Keep in corked 
shell vials or large homeo vials. 
For more detailed account of killing and fixing methods for insects, with refer- 
ence to other fixing agents and special cases, see Comstock and Kellogg's Elements 
of insect anatomy, chap. VIII (p. 121-13g), 1901 ; for exhaustive account of 
many killing and fixing agents (for miscellaneous animals) see Lee's Microtomists' 
vadc-mecum. Also see these two references for 'more detailed consideration of 
the subjects of the following paragraphs. 
Hardening, dehydrating, and clearing.^ When ready to carry material further. 
select from the stock of properly killed and fixed specimens (preserved in 85% 
alcohol) the particular specimens desired to study and transfer to 95% alcohol for 
from 12 to 24 hours ; then to absolute alcohol for from I 2 to 24 hours; then to a 
half-and-half mixture of absolute alcohol and cedar-wood oil (or xylol). Pour the 
oil slowly into the vial containing the specimens in absolute alcohol ; the oil and 
alcohol will remain distinct at first, the specimens keeping in the alcohol; as the 
two liquids gradually mix the specimens will become gradually (and hence safely) 
infiltrated with the new mixture. Leave in this mixture for from 12 to 24 hours. 
Transfer to pure cedar-wood oil (or xylol); leave from 12 to 24 hours. The speci- 
mens are now ready to be infiltrated with and imbedded in paraffine preparatory 
to cutting by the microtome. 
Infiltrating and imbeddine Remove specimens from pure cedar-wood oil, in 
which they may remain without injury indefinitely if for any reason the worl' . must 
be interrupted, into cedar-wood oil into which about half the same bulk of paraffine 
shavings have been dropped and allowed to dissolve. This mixture should be kept 
in a watch glass or small dish at a temperature of about 45' C. To do this keep 
the dish in the paraffine oven or at the back end of an imbedding triangle. (Paraf- 
fine oven or imbedding triangle may be obtained of dealers in microscopic supplies.) 
Remove specimens from mixture of paraffine and cedar-wood oil after from three 
to six hours, depending on size and thickness of body wall of specimens, to melted 
pure paraffine of 54O C. melting point. This paraffine must be kept melted in paraf- 
fine oven or on imbedding triangle. The temperature should not be allowed to go 
up much higher than the melting point of the paraffine and never to fall below it 




================================================================================


120 PSYCHE [June 
until the infiltrating is complete. 
This infiltration with pure paraffine will require 
from three to twelve hours, depending upon the size of specimens, and character 
of body wall. If it is necessary to interrupt the infiltration, the specimens in the 
melted paralTine should not be allowed to cool slowly but the paraffine should be 
hardenedquickly by placing the paraffine dish on the surface of cold water and 
plunging it beneath the surface as soon as a firm film forms over the top of the 
paraffine. The parafine can later be gradually melted and the infiltration pro- 
ceeded with. When ready to imbed, pour some melted paraffine into a small paper 
boat or into a watch glass and transfer the specimens into this boat or watch glass, 
orienting them with a warm needle. Cool the paraffine quickly by putting boat 
or watch glass into cold water. (Do not plunge beneath surface of water until film 
forms on top of paraffine.) After cooling the paraffine, remove paper from around 
the block, or cut the block out from the watch glass, and wrap up in paper or put 
in a vial properly labeled. The specimens in these blocks may be kept indefinitely. 
Cutti7zg.- The work of cutting sections with a microtome must be learned by 
observation and experience. The many kinds of microtomes make any general 
description of the process impossible. For cutting insect tissues, where the whole 
body is sectioned or where any part of the body wall has to be cut, a heavy and 
rigid microtome is necessary. The light, swift, wheel microtomes are not the best 
for such work. I have found the large, heavy machine known as Minot's New 
Automatic Microtome, with large knife rigidly fastened at both ends, the best 
instrument, of several tried, for work with insects. The fixed knife and sliding 
object-carrier automatically raised make possible the ribboning of sections, while 
the horizontal position of the knife and the arrangement for the adjustment by hand 
of the block for each cut make it possible to pay that special attention to each sec- 
tion necessary in particular cases. With this microtome I have made complete 
series of such heavily chitinized specimens as the pupae of blepharocerid flies or 
the heads of various adult insects. With hard paraffine and a rigid powerful micro- 
tome strongly chitinized insect cuticle can be successfully cut without-distorting or 
tearing the soft tissues lying next to it. For the study of the histolytic and histo- 
genetic phenomena in the pupae of insects with complete metamorphosis it is neces- 
sary to make uninterrupted series of complete body sections including the heavy 
pupal cuticle. Hence the necessity of having in the entomological laboratory a 
microtome capable of such strenuous work. 
The sections as cut may be transferred by brush or forceps or needle to a 
sheet of paper until the cutting is finished, or may be put directly on the slide. 
The slide should be well cleaned and dried and then smeared over with (almost) 
the thinest possible coating of Mayer's albumen fixative. 
Arrange the sections 
in regular order in lines transverse or longitudinal to the slide, and when it is

covered (leaving always I sq. in. at one end for the label, to be put on later) gently 
flow enough distilled water from a pipette over it to float up all of the sections. 
Put' the slide in a safe place to allow the water gradually to evaporate and the sec- 
tions to dry thoroughly: they will, presumably, have spread 011t and dried perfectly 
flat and unfolded against the thinly smeared surface of the slide. Now gently heat 
the slide over a small flame until the paraffine of the sections has melted and thus 
further flattened and settled the sections against the glass surface. Let the paraf- 
fine harden, and put the slide into a small glass jar of pure xylol. 
Clearing^ ~r/&zng^ and mounting.- The xylol will dissolve away the paraffine in 
and enclosing the sections ; leave slide in xylol for at least fifteen minutes ; even 
a longer time is better. Then transfer to absolute alcohol for fifteen minutes to 
remove the xylol; then to 95 alcohol for from five to ten minutes ; then to 75 % 
alcohol for five minutcs ; then to 50% alcohol for five minutes ; then into the alco- 
holic staining solution. There is a host of stains, some simple, some complex, some 
for general use, some for very particular and limited use. The beginner wants a 
simple stain for general use ; and if lie can get it in alcoholic solution, acidulated, 
he is relieved from carrying his slide through three or four more little jars contain- 
ing, variously, water and acidulated alcohol. Transferring the slides through the 
alcohol series of lessening strength is simply to prevent the dangerously violent 
diffusion currents which are set up when an object saturated in strong alcohol is 
brought directly into weak alcohol. And if a stain in aqueous solution is used the 
series has obviously lo be a longer one. For the beginner I recommend the use of 
Ehrlich's acid haematoxylin as a thoroughly satisfactory general stain. It is strong; 
staining quickly; it is an alcoholic solution, saving running the slides down to 
water; it is acidulated saving the differentiating bath in acid alcohol. It is cheap, 
and is a sharp, clean, pleasantly colored stain. 
Leave slide in this stain from two lo five minutcs ; only experience will deter- 
mine the actual time [or each slide. Wash slide in 50% alcohol; transfer to 75% 
alcohol for ten minutes; then to 85% alcohol for five minutes; then to 95% alcohol 
for five minutes ; then to absolute alcohol for ten minutes ; then to xylol for ten 
minutes. With thin balsam ready, remove the slidc from xylol and put three or 
four drops of the balsam on it, and carefully but quickly, so as to prevent drying

NOTES ON THE IMMATURE STAGES OF SOME TINGITIDS OF 
THE GENUS CORYTHUCA. PLATE 3. 
BY AUSTIN W. MORRILL, PH. D., ENTOMOLOGICAL LABORATORY, MASSACHUSETTS 
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, AMHERST, MASS. 
The study of these insects by the writer was begun 
as a consequence of 
noting the maiked difference which was evident between the eggs of the oak- 
inhabiting TINGE of this locality and the eggs figured in Comstock's Manual for 
the Study of Insects as those of Corytlmca arcuczta. Later it was found that the 
young of the Buttonwood TINGIS (Coiythzica aliata) so closely resemble those of 
the Oak TINGIS as to make their distinction possible only by microscopic examina- 
tion. 
Say's description of Corytfmca arcuafa covers several closely allied forms 
which may be considered species in the process of formation. Others which are 
recognized as distinct species appear to be very closely allied; at least in their 
adult condition. The differences, which are noted in this paper, in the immature 
stages of the Oak, Hawthorn, and Buttonwood tingitids indicate that the relation- 
ships of these perplexing forms will be better understood when the egg and nymph 
stages of each have been studied. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE IMMATURE STAGES OF THE OAK TINGE, Corythtca 
aimata Say. 
Egg [Plate 3, figs. I and a) : su"b1liptical in outline, basal end rather pointed, apical 
end capped with a narrow cylindrical collar or band surmounted by a low pyramid with 
from fifteen to twenty ridges extending from the base to the apex. 
From the apex of this 
pyramid there usually arises a slender filament which is variable in length hut as a rule about 
one fifth as long' as the egg. Below the collar the egg is evenly covered with a thin layer 
of wax, jet black in color, and rough, resembling- sand paper under low power objectives. 
This outer wax covering may be easily rubbed off, disclosing the smooth shiny black egg 
chorion. 
The pyramidal portion of the apical cap may be either whitish or black. The 
length of the egg, not including the apical filament, is about .56 mrn., its greatest width 
about .24 mm. 
For the purpose of simplifying the following description of the nymphs I will 
designate the three principal types of spines found in the nymph stages as follows : 




================================================================================


I 28 PSYCHE [August 
trumpet-shaped spines which arise from 
conical, sub-conical, or elongated thick 
protuberances as 'type no. I; trumpet-shaped spines which arise directly from the 
surface of the body or its appendages as type no. 2; and long simple spines which 
arise directly from the surface of the body or its appendages as type no. 3. 
Firyf in-star (PI. 3, figs. 3 and 4) :- Length about .53 mm., greatest width about .24 mm. 
The general form is an elongated ellipse, the head end being a little more broadly rounded 
than the anal end. When first hatched the body is pale in color but gradually turns to dark 
brown and in afew hours acquires a greenish tint. The rostrum,-except the tip which is 
brown, -antennae, and legs are pale yellowish but soon become greenish. This greenish 
color of the body and appendages is apparently internal, perhaps due to the blood. The 
part of the head which projects in front of the prothorax when viewed from above is almost 
semicircular in outline. The hinder fifth of the head is rounded and covered by the prono- 
turn. The compound eyes consisting of five reddish facets each, are situated on the extreme 
sides of the head just in front of the pronoti-im. Anterior to and a little below the eyes arise 
the three segmented antenna, the first two segments of which are short and stout, subequal 
in size, the second one bearing a very few slender spines. The terminal segment is about as 
long as the first two together, clavale, broadest at about three fourths of the distance toward 
.lie iipcx, from which point it tapers gradually toward the base and rapidly toward the tip. 
It is slightly tin-ved posieriorly and is provided with long- spines some of which a-re of type 
no. 3 and others of type no. 3, also will1 many small simple spurs and blunt sense cones near 
the tip. 
The entire length of the antenna is about two fifths the length of the body. 
The 
rostrum is four segmented and about three fifths as long as the entire body, reaching when 
bent backwards, to the middle of the fifth abdominal segment The rostra1 setae are 
comparatively stout. The labrum is hpiline and about two thirds as long as the basal 
segment of the rostrum. Beginning at the upper side of each eye there is a light btrcak in 
the integument above, which curves forward and then backward to a point about opposite its 
origin in the middle line of the head where it nleets Us fellow and a median longitudinal 
streak which extends back to the base of the abdomen. It is along these streaks that the 
integument splits when the insect moults. On each of the two obtuse angles formed by the 
union of the transverse streaks on the head and the median longili~dinal streak are situated 
two stout spines, one being directly in front of the other,-the posterior spines of type no. 
2 being directed posteriorly, the anterior spines of type no. I being directed anteriorly- 
Two very minute spines of type no. 2 arise on each side of the median streak between the 
babes of the two posterior spines. Near the anterior end of the head there are two more 
pairs of spines of type no. I, situated one spine of each pair on each side of the middle line. 
The subconical protuberances from which the posterior pair of tlie&e spines arise, unite at 
their base. 
The thorax from above is about as long as the head from front to rear and is slightly 
wider than the head at its widest part. The prothorax is a little larger than the inesothorax 
and the mesothorax is a little larger than the metathorax. The pro-and mesothorax hear on 
each lateral margin a spine of type no. I, which with its base is about one sixth the width of 
the thorax. On each side of the median streak of the prothorax there are two minute 
circular openings appearing as minute light spots. On each side of the median streak of 
the mesothorax arises a spine of type no. I. The legs are quite stout and when straightened 
arc nearly as long as the body. The coxae are stout, ncarly as long as broad. The

Lrochanters appear to be present though difficult to distinguish. 
The tibiae are a little 
longer than the femora and more slender, at the tip bearing several short stont spines. The 
tarsus consist of two segments, the basal segment being small, not very distinct, and tr-ian- 
gnlar in outline viewed from the side; while the last tarsal segment is rounded above, flat 
below and bears lwo stout claws at its tip. The two tarsd segments of each leg together 
are a little more than one half as long as the tibia. A few slender spines occur on the 
various segments of the legs. 
The abdomen consists of ten segments, only nine of which are ordinarily visible from 
above. 
The ninth is quite long and bends downward so that the short anal segment is 
nearly perpendicular to the surface upon which the insect rest?. This scpent - the 
tenth -appears kidney bliaped -\vhen viewed from the side, with the concave surface where 
the anal opening is situated directed downward. The second to the ninth segments 
inclusive, bear on their lateral margins, &pines of type no. I 
which concspond to those 
described on the sides of the pro- and mesothorax. The dorsnm of the second abdominal 
segment bears two spines which correspond to those on the dorsum of the mesothorax. 
The fifth and sixth segments are much swollen in the middle of the dorsnm and each of them 
hears three spines on each side, the posterior one being of type no. I and smaller than the 
other two which are of type no. 2. On each side of the mid-dorsal line of the eighth 
segment tliere arises a spine of type no. 2. Directly behind each of these near the posterior 
margin of the eighth segment arises a spine of type no. I. Minute pores and spines also 
occur on the dorsum, the latter being confined mostly lo the middle of the sixth segment. 
A little mesad from each lateral margin, on the ventral surface of the second to eighth 
segments inclusive, are projections not unlike truncated cones, at the outer, smaller end of 
which are the tracheal openings. A little mesad to the openings on each side of the body 
on the venter of each of the fifth, sixth, and seventh segments is a slender spine of type no. 
3. On each side of the second to eighth segments about opposite the spiracles viewed from 
above are small areas bounded by chitinous rings. These structures disappear at the first 
moult and their significance is not known. They appear to be located just below the surface 
of the body, hence are not represented in the figure. 
Second instar (PI. 3, fig. 5) : Length varying from 1.2 to 1.32 mm.; the greatest wid111 
from .68 1nm. to .p mm. 
The change which occur? at the first moult is not great. The 
body becomes somewhat broader in proportion to its length. The rostrum reaches to about 
the caudal margin of the second abdominal segment. The legs are shorter in proportion to 
the length of the body than before, being n little less than two thirds as long as it. The 
entirc dorsnm of the lhoe except for certain definite areas is covered vith minute dark col- 
ored spines. On the venter these spines occur only near the lateral margin. 
The dorsal 
spines of the first ins& have been changed in Iwo wa~s : first, iiew ones have been added, 
and secondly, spines of type no. I which in the first instar arose from small protiil~eranccs 
(PI. 3, fig. 4) now aribe from protuberances which average about the same length as the 
spines themselves, which are in å´mos cases actually shorter t11;in before. The prhicipal 
additions of spines in the hcacl region are: rt minute one of type no. I added to the pair of 
the same t?pc which occur just behind the most anterior pair ; two small spines of type no. 
I and one small spine u-f type no. 2 added to each of the next two groups wliich oeciir one 
on each side of the middle line between the eves. Elsewhere on the dorsuni are the folio'.\.- 
i11g additions: four minute spines of type no. I noÌ¤ occur on the prothomcic segment, two 
on each side of the middle line, one being ne:ir the anterior margin and the other near the 
posterior mugin of the segment; on the mesothorax two spines of tvpc no. 2 have been 




================================================================================


130 PSYCHE [AU~US~ 
added on each side of the middle just caudad to the spines of type no. I which were present 
in the first instar; just mesad from the base of each protuberance whichgives rise to the 
niarginal spines of type no. I on the pro- and mesothorax and on the second to ninth 
abdominal segments arises a spine which may be either of type no. 2 or of type no. 3 ; and 
minute side protuberances giving rise to spines of type no. I begin to appear as buds from 
the protuberances on the margin of the pro- and mesoLhorax. Here and there among the 
miimte dark spines on the surface of the body are minute circular openings from which, 
when viewed obliquely, little sac-like bodies are seen to protrude. 
Third iiiisfar (PI. 3, fig. 6) : Length varying from I rnin. to 1.06 mm., the greatest width 
from .52 to .56 mm. This instar does not diffcr greatly in structure from the previous one. 
The portion of the antenna which represents the apical segment of the previous instar is 
now indistinctly divided into two segments, the outer one being slightly shorter than the 
inner 0111.:. 
The rostrum reaches to about the posterior margin of the first abdominal 
segment. 
'She pro- and mesothorax are proportionally broader than before and the former 
is proportionally longer from front lo rear. The protuberances which give rise to spines 
of type no. I are now, as a rule, about twice as long as the spines. Nearly all of the 
spines of type no. 3 of the previous instar are now present in the form of type no. 3. A 
few spines of type no. 2 appear for the first time on thc outer sides of the tibiae. The num- 
ber of facets of the eyes has increased to eleven or twelve. A few small spines of type, no. I 
appear for the first time on the lateral margins of the pro- and mesothorax anterior to those 
present in the previous instar, and also one or two similar ones arise from the sides of the 
protuberances which give rise to Llic spines on each lateral margin of the pro- and meso- 
thorax and o-t the fourth to seventh or eighth abdominal segments. As a rule there is one 
which arises from the under side of each of these protuberances. Between the facets on. the 
posterior side of each eye arises a spine of type no. 3. 
Fourth iksiar (PI. 3, figs. 7 and 8) : Length varying from 1.3 mm. to I.+! mm., greatest 
width from .74 inm. to .86 mm. The in051 noticeable change which takes place at the third 
moult is the first appearance of the wing pads; which arise as curved, backward growths of 
the sides of the mesothorax, giving this segment of tlie body a form suggestive of the oul- 
line of. a dumbbell. The wing pads extend back on each side to a little beyond the anterior 
margin of the first abdominal segment. Tlie prothoi'ax is propostionally longer than before, 
and the facets of tlic eyes are more than twice as numerous as before. The terminal seg- 
ment of the antenna has not increased in lcngtli in proportion to the other segments and 
is now about two thirds as long as the third or preceding segment. The constriction 
between the two terminal segments is more marked than before. The rostrum reaches to 
itbout the base of the abdomen. Spines of type no. I now arise from bases which average 
about four times as long as the spines. A few more spincs of this type have made their 
appearance arising from the bases of those previously present on the lateral margins of the 
pro- and mesothorax and of the fourth to seventh segments of the abdomen, and a single 
one of the same type has arisen independently on the lateral margins of the pro- and meso- 
thorax in front of those which appeared independently in previous instars. 
Fifth is'siar (PI. 3, fig. 9): Length varying from 1.86 mm. to 2 mm., greatest width 
from 1.1 min. to 1.36 mm. Quite a marked change in form occurs at the fourth moult, the 
most noticeable of which is the increased lenofli of the prothorax in proportion to tlie length 
of the body and the increase in length of the wing pads. The prothorax now occupies a little 
more than one fourth the entire length of the body. Tile wing pads now extend hack on each 
side a little beyond the posterior margin of the fourth abdominal segment. On tlie outer 




================================================================================


side of each wing- pad about four fifths of the distance from the tip to the base is a prominent 
shoulder. 
The rostrum i-caches to about the middle of the mesothorax. 
The fourth segment 
of the antenna is novr about one half as longas the third. 
Spines of types nos. 2 and 3 are 
more numerous than before on the antennae and legs. 
On the head four more spines of type 
no. I appear in connection with the group present in the previous instar: -one on each side 
of the second (next to the anterior) group, and one on each of the two posterior groups. A 
few small spincs of type no. I appear for the first time on the sides of the pro- and meso- 
thorax and of the fourth to ninth abdominal segments. The second and third abdominal 
segments have lost the spines of type no. I which in previous instars were present on their 
lateral margins. The area covered by the minute dark spines is much more limited than 
before. The integument is shaded with brown as before except where there are large spaces 
devoid of these small spines ; the color here is dull yellow, thus giving a somewhat broken 
light hand across the body in the region of the tips of the wing pads. The facets of the eyes 
are much more numerous than in the previous instar. 
The eggs of the OAK TINGIS are found on the under surfaces of the leaves, 
usually near the larger ribs and in groups ranging from two or three to more than 
one hundred in numbers. Single isolated eggs are occasionally found. 
Judging 
from the number of eggs as compared with the number of adults early in the sum- 
mer, many eggs must be laid by each female. During the last few days in May of 
the present year (1~0~) it was observed that, on those oak leaves where any of the. 
insects occurred, a male and a female were usually found together ; rarely one and; 
slill more rarely three and four individuals, were found on a single leaf. On many 
of the leaves where there was but one pair of the insects the numbers of eggs ranged; 
from twenty-five to fifty. 
The nymphs remain together in clusters. 
Their wanderings on the under sur- 
face of a leaf are marked by their shiny, black, rounded excrements which are 
apparently deposited on the leaf by means of the peculiar tenth abdominal seg- 
ment already described. The moulted skins of the nymphs remain attached to the 
leal by their tarsal claws as already observed by Comstock in the Hawthorn 
TINGIS. 
The upper surfaces, particularly along the sides of the mid ribs, of leaves of 
badly infested trees, turn dirty pale green, sometimes mottled with reddish, and the 
ornamental effect of whole trees may be greatly impaired by midsummer unless 
spraying is resorted to. 
From two to three days intervene between each succeeding moult up to the 
fourth, and from six to seven days between the fourth and fifth moults. The 
duration of the egg stage is unknown to the writer, but eggs laid on the leaves of 
certain oaks on the college grounds about the middle of May were unhatched on 
June first, the time of the present writing. 
The adults hibernate beneath the bark, under leaves, and among rubbish.

PSYCHE [August 
The writer has found adults of C. ci/iir/a. hibernating in large numbers in crevices 
in an old wooden fence which ran below the branches of a buttonwood tree. 
A few very small pinkish immature I~eteropterous insects were once found to 
be very active in destroying the young nymphs of the Oak TINGIS but none were 
bred to maturity. The adult form of a well-known predaceous heteropteron - 
TiipAZefs insidwsus Say - has been found feeding on the young of C. ciliata and 
from the similarity in the general appearance and habits of this adult and the 
immature forms just mentioned 
it seems probable that they were of the same 
species. 
A group of oaks on the college grounds gave an excellent opportunity for 
observations on the food plants of the Oak TIXGIS. 
The following oaks were found 
to be badly infested : white oak (Quercus albaj, chestnut oak (&. prinus), English 
oak (Q. rulm), and dwarf chestnut oak (Q. acuminafa). The following were 
apparently entirely immune to the attack of the insect although they stood so near 
to badly infested trees that their branches touched in some cases: scarlet oak 
(Q. coccinea), scrub oak (Q. UlicifuZia) , and laurel oak (Q. Zawifelia). A specimen 
of mossy cup oak (Q. macrocarpa) growing a few hundred yards away was slightly 
infested. 
During the summer of 1902 there was received at the Hatch Experiment 
Station of the college a branch of hawthoin from Concord. Mass., which was sub- 
mitted to the writer for examination. 
The leaves were discolored and practically 
dead, which condition appeared to be due to a combination of both insect and 
fungus pests. Among the remains of various insects, a few moulted skins of 
tingitids were found "which corresponded very well with the respective instances of 
tile Oak TINGIS. A few eggs were also found upon the hawthorn leaves whicli 
agreed with the figure and description given by Comstock in his report for r879 
(Rept. Cornm. Agi-ic., 1879, 1880, p. 221). The eggs are there described as 
follows : 
"The eggs of these insects . . . . are smooth, whitish, glistening, semi- 
transparent, and ovoid in shape. Their average length is .3 mm. (.OI inch). 
They are deposited on their broad end, and seem to be somewl~it inserted into the 
substance of the leaf; they are corei-cd completely by a brown, sticky substance 
which hardens soon after oviposition. It adheres so firmly to the egg, especially 
to the upper portion, that it is impossible to remove it without crushing the egg- 
At its upper end this covering of the egg is squarely truncate, giving the whole 
mass the appearance of the frustum of a cone with a porous lid. . . . . They 




================================================================================


bear a much greater resemblance to certain forms of fungi, notably the genus 
Phoma, and to certain homoptei-ous galls than they do to eggs of any sort." 
Uhler, 
to whom were referred the specimens of the Hawthorn TINGIS in his note cleter- 
mining the species said : "Your specimens of TIXIS belong to the genus 
Corythz~ca, and seem to be a new pliytophagic hi-in of Co?y//zzca arcuata Say. 
It 
will hardly do to makc a new species out of this insect, as it is one of the several 
forms which tit into Say's species. 
It comes near to the race belonging to the 
Yuglans nz<?ra ." 
Better malerial than that which 1 have thus far examined would probably show 
some differences in the nymphs of the oak- and hawthorn-inhabiting TINGIS but 
from a comparison of the eggs alone it is evident that the two forms should not be 
considered identical or even local varieties. 1 suggest therefore that the subspeci- 
fic name Co7ythrtca arcuata wata& be used in association with the common name 
Hawthorn TTNGIS, while Oak TINGE be exclusively used for the common name of 
Cory//;z;ca armala. Say in his description not having mentioned the food-plant, it 
will be necessary thus to designate a variety as the type of the species, and the 
oak infesting variety seems to be the most commonly accepted type. 
THE BUTTOKWOOD TINGIS, Corytfwca ciliata Say. 
While to the naked eye or with a hand lens the young stages of C. arcvata and 
C. ciliata are almost inseparable, with a compound microscope, using an objective 
not lower than one half inch, the two species can be readily distinguished. The 
most striking characters of each instar of C. ciliata by which it can be distin- 
guished from C. arcuata are here given : - 
fist i~~sfar: The spines corresponding to typcs no. 1 and no. 2 are not trumpet shaped 
hut ;ue rounded and much larger at the tip than in C, arcuata. 
Spines corresponding to 
tvpe no. 2 are especially prominent on the antennae. 
Seco,t,d instar: Most of the spines which correspond in position to type no. I in 
C. arcuafa arc novi- poinled at the tips; a few have not completely changed from their 
form ir the first instar. The antcnnuc buar prominent spines as before. 
Th/nf,~/oui fh, n/,///W/c instars: These stages are best di~tinguished from the co~i'espond- 
ing- stages of C. arcaaiu by the presence of spines corresponding to type nu. I but with the 
torin described h the first inst~ir. 
The spines on the antenriae are less prominent tlliln i!: 
the first tno instnrs. 
This species was found to be extremely abundant at Amhcrst, Mass., in Sep- 
tember, 1902, on the leaves of a b~ittomvood or sycamore tree (J^atatiiis ociidenfafis} 
growing near the college grounds. Many adults were found under the bark as late 
as the first of June, 1903, but none were found on the leaves. Unfortunately no 
eggs were collected in the autumn with the other stages, and in the spring none were 
found in time to allow noks to be made on them for this paper.

SOME HITHERTO UNKNOWN NYMPHS OF ODONATA FROM 
NEW MEXICO. 
BY JAMES C. NEXDHAM, LAKE FOREST, ILL., AND T, -Us A. COCKERELL, 
PECOS, X. MEX.' 
During the year 1902, dragon-fly nymphs were collected in three Ncw Mexico 
localities, each of which yielded material of interest. 
(A,) 
Las figas Hot Springs, 6709 ft. alt. 
A few years ago some specimens of Hyponeura /ugc?;s were collected at Las 
Vegas Hot Springs, and upon investigation it appeared that the species occurred 
there as a permanently established and tolerably numerous colony. This excited 
some surprise, as the place is hundreds of miles from the nearest previously-known

not merely from the absence of other New Mexico records, but from the fact that 
we could not find the species in other localities, such as the Arroyo Pecos, which 
, were very prolific in agrionines. 
The search lor nymphs of Hypumra was at first

unsuccessful. 
The hot springs thenlselves are apparently too hot for insect life 
though they contain a variety of algae1 (Zygnema cmciatiim, Oscillaria fioelichii 
viridis, 0. spletzdida, Stigeodonium tenue, UZothrix speciosa, Zj~og-onhim å´fia~vztlum 
Beggiatoa alba marina, Oedosonit~m sp., LSirogy~z sp., Telrnsfora sp., and Nicc sp.). 
The ten~perature of the water was found to be 121" Fahr. Search was next made 
in the little streams running from the hot springs, and here nymphs were found, 
but they proved to be referable to some unknown species of Argia. No further 
investigations were made for several months, but in September Hjå´ponezw nymphs 
were at last found in abundance, clinging to stones in the Gallinas River at Las 
Vegas Hot Springs. The place where they occurred is just where the hot water 
runs into the river, and the river is perceptibly warmed in consequence. It does 
not seem impossible that this condition has permitted the existence o[ the ffyponeura 
colony (derived in the first instance perhaps from the eggs of some wandering 
individual), the normal waters of the surrounding region being too cold for the 
species. At the same place were found larvae of Anopheles pseztdopmutipennis 
Theobald, determined by Dr. L. 0. Howard who informs us that the species was 
lately described from Grenada, and is new to the United States, but adds that 
there is a single specimen in the U. S. Nat. Mus., collected by Belfrage in Texas 
and hitherto overlooked. Larvae have been sent to Dr. 11. G. Dyar, who finds 
them different from true A. piifi4hwnis. There was also collected a leech, 
ErpofideZZa punctata Leicly (clct. J. Percy Moore), apparently new to the fauna 
of Neiv Mexico. The Hjponeura nymphs were not bred to the adult stage, but 
as the generic characters can be seen in the nymphs, it is safe to assume that the 
species is the same as that caught flying in the same immediate locality. If the 
above suggestions concerning the origin and character of the IIYPONEURA colony 
are correct, we may look for signs of modification tending towards the establishment 
of a new race or species. At present it is not possible to compare sufficient num- 
bers of specimens from different localities to determine whether such modification 
exists, either in average or absolute characters. 
HYPOXEURA LL'GENS Selys. 
A number of nymphs in alcohol, obtained From the Gallinas River, Las Vegas

Apparently none of the specimens are fully grown, 
but they are large enough to show the main features of the venation of the adult in 
their developing wings, and thus to render certain their generic determination.

segments feebly developed in the younger specimens, the ratio of length of segments from 
the 
base 
outward being I : 1.3 : 2 : 1.5 : I : .8 : .j. 
Hind angles of the head prominent, 
obtusely rounded, scurf! pubescent, with a vide but shallow notch on the hind margin 
between thcm. Labium short, the hinge reaching posteriorly only so far as the middle of 
the prothorax. Mentum 11it11 a very prominent, entire median lobe, and with no mental 
setae. Lateral lobes short and stout, each with a strong arcuate movable hook and a single 
weak raptorial seta just before base of hook. The end hook is cut 06 from the inner margin 
by a feebly developed notch and above it on the end of the lateral lobe is a second similar 
but somewhat smaller hook, that is denticulate on its external margin. 
Prothomx short, widened and thickened toward its rear margin. Legs short, sto-i~t, 
thinly fringed with hairs. Wing uses (in the oldest of thebe imm'eitu~'e specimens) reaching 
only the middle of the 2d abdominal segment, 
Abdomen cylindric, the segments of nearly equal length, except at ends where somewhat 
shorter, the loth segment excised on mid-dorsal margin. Gills oblong. widest just beyxid 
the middle, suddenly contracted to both ends, the superior a little shorter than the laterals, 
all subinflated in the basal half, and with very prominent lateral carinae along the axis. 
Color pattern unusually wAl developed. General color greenish brov:n, paler below and 
en sutures : a mid-clors~il 1.o~ of pale triangles on the abdominal segments, one on each 
segment, and a pale line each side, and a row of oblique pale streaks in the darker color of 
the side margin. Theie is a bluckish lateral band exteiiding from the rear of the eves along 
the sides of the head and prot.hoi-ax. All the femora bear two distinct broad rings of blackish 
brown, the distal one being the more proininent, the gills are blackish, white tipped, and 
each shows an imperfect pale subapical transverse band starting inward from the opposite 
margins and of different extent in different spcciinens. The depth of color varies greatly 
with remoteness from time of moulting, but the general pattern is quite apparent in all but 
the most recently moulted. 
Material more recently collected from the same place on March zist, 1903, 
includes some larger specimens measuring in length of body 16 mm., having wing 
cases reaching the middle of the 3d abdominal segment. 
This nymph is at once distinguished from our other known agrionine nymphs 
by a very primitive character : the possession of triquetral gills, having swollen 
base and thick lateral carinae. Of all the nymphs of Oclonata hitherto made known 
they are most like the fossil nymphs of the genus SAMARURA described by Brauer! 
Redtenbacher, and Ganglbauer in the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of St. 
Petersburgh, vol. 36, 1888, from the Jura formation of East Siberia. The gills 
are very similar. Nymphs of ~IYPOKEURA agree closely with those of the genus 
ARGIA, differing chiefly by their much greater size, shorter labium, absence of well 
developed raptorial setae, and thicker gills. The species of ARGIA from stre~~inlets 
of warm water above mentioned has triquetral gills, possessing strong lateral carinae, 
but they are thinner and more pointed than the gills of HYPONEURA nymphs. In 
Argiapufrida Hagen, which clings to the rocks in rapid streams or on ware beaten 
shores, there are Feebly developed latcral cai-inae at the base; but the other species

of ARGIA that live in quiet waters and come into direct competition with nymphs of 
other genera, have the gills quite thin and flat. 
(B.) 
The Arroyo Pecos, near J.as Vegas. 
The Arroyo Pecos (by no means to be confused with the Pecos River) is a 
gully to the east of Las Vegas, where a small stream cuts through the fossilifcrous 
Pleistocene beds, and even into the underlying Cretaceous shales. The stream is 
small and the water is so alkaline that drivers of vehicles crossing it will not usually 
allow their horses to drink. Here and there arc pools and marshy places. On 
June 7 search was made for Odonata in a marshy place in the arroyo, and along 
the borders of an artificial pond not far off. Agrionines only were observed breecl- 
ing, but these were exceedingly numerous. The males were holding the fcmales 
by the neck with their abdominal appendages, while the latter oviposited in the 
water. At the same time nymphs were leaving [.he water, and several placed in 
paper bags gave forth adult flies. It would seem that either the hatching season 
is quite prolonged, or else the ovipositing occurs very shortly after einergmce. 
Three species were represented, as set forth below. EnalZagvza civile was very 
abundant, but Ischnwa $e'rparva was scarcely less numerous, while I. dawzu/cz 
occurred in fair numbers around the pond. 
EXALLAGMA CTVIT.E Hagen. 
This widely distributed North American ENALLAGMA was bred from nymphs 
collected at Arroyo Pecos, Las Vcgas, N. Mexico on the 7th of June, 1902. 
The 
nymphs of this genus are so much alike that it is hardly worth while to repeat the 
detailed description given in the Bulletin of the New York State Museum. It will 
be sufficient here to state the more distinctive characters of this species. The 
immature stages were unknown at the time the above mentioned Bulletin was 
written. 
Length 19-20 mm., gills 6 mm. additional. 
Form as in others of the genus. 
Gills with- 
out color paitern save for scanty pigmentation along the larger tracheae.

Lateral setae 
5. 
End of the lateral labial lobe viith end hook as usual, but above it on tlic margin are 
three larger followed by three smaller, obsolescent teeth, the latter covering the outer angle. 
This little western species was also bred from nymphs collected at Arroyo 
Pecos, Las Vegas, N. Mexico, on Junc 7, 1902. 
Its nymph agrees closely with 




================================================================================


138 
PSYCHE [August 
that of other members of the genus in general characters as stated in the above 
cited Bulletin. Its more distinctive characters are the following: - 
Length H inni., gills 4 mm. additional. Gills plainly colored, a little darker along- the 
axis. but without spots or bands. 
Mental setae of labium four each side in an equal uniform 
series; lateral setae 5. 
On the end of the lateral lobe above the end hook are three distinct 
teeth, and the obliquely truncated outer angle is obscurely denticulate. 
Two pairs of }schnura damzda Calveit (recently described in Biol. Centr. 
Amer., f only) were taken at Arroyo Pecos on June 7 along with the above 
described forms. 
Both females are old and pruinose blue. They measure in total 
length 27 mm., abdomen 20 mm., hind wing- I j mm. There is no ventral spine 
on the 8th abdominal segment. 
The stigma is distinctly smaller (smaller by about 
one third) in the hind wing than in the fore. 
The hind margin of the prothorax is 
slightly concave on either side of the dorsuni, produced backward in the middle and 
divided there by a minute median notch. The nasus is metallic green, but the top 
of the head and thorax, the upper surfaces of the femora, and the whole doisurn of 
the abdomen (save for invading streaks of yellowish on the sides of the ad seg- 
merit) are blackish pruinose. 
On the east side of the Pecos River, near Roswell, is a line of red bluffs 
consisting of impure gypsum. 
At the foot of these bluffs is a series of small lakes, 
which are so deep as to be popularly reputed "bottomless." 
These lakes are so 
strongly impregnated with salts that the water is hardly suitable for drinking pur- 
poses. Along their margins dragon-fly nymphs may be found, and dragon-flies 
(mostly libellulines) were observed to be very numerous. 
The identification of the species of Dyihemis is more or less uncertain. 
Captain Pope collected on the Pecos River S. 7d0x Hag., D. &ax Hag., and 
D. niemlax Hag. Dy/henzis (now Brechmorhop) mendax may be eliminated 
because its venation does not agree with that of the nymphal wings: as between 
D. velex and D. figax, judging by size alone, the nymphs should belong to the 
latter, rather larger species, but the former only was collected at the same time 
and place. 
In Proc. Davenport Acad. Sci. vol. 9 (1902), p. 51, it is inferred that Pope 
collected his material at very different localities above the river, since he obtained 
both MeZanophtx bivift&s and M. differentials, which inhabit different life-zones. 
However, in 1902 it was observed that these two grasshoppers do actually occur 
together at Roswell. As it is not very likely that their ranges overlap very much, 




================================================================================


19031 NEED/IAA/, COCKERELL: - ATMPH.5- OF ODOWA I39 
it thus seems likely that Pope's collections, if all from one place, were from the 
vicinity of the present town of Roswell, rather than from Lat. j3O (the present 
boundary between New Mexico and Texas), as Hagen indicates. In all probabil- 
ity, however, the collections were made in several places. 
The following species of Odonata were collected at the same place and time 
as the nymphs described below: LjYhemis ve/ox Hagen, .Libel/u/a odiom Hagen, 
Plathemis subornafa Hagen, Meso//;e?nis collocata Hagen, E,nallqma civile Hagen, 
JE. basidens Calvert, Hetaerina americana Beauv., and a single undeterminable 
female of a spccies of AKGIA. Of these, the first five agree perfectly with the 
descriptions of the types, sent originally by Captain Pope from this same locality. 
DYTHEMIS SP.? 
Four cast nymphal skins collected at Dimmitt Lake near Roswell, N. Mex., in 
August, 1902. 
These constitute a valuable discovery, since no. nymphs of this 
genus or any of its immediate neighbors in the system have been made Imowii 
hitherto. The generic determination is possible because the venation of the adult 
is well marked in many important particulars upon the empty wing sheaths. 
Length 20 mm., abdomen 12 mm., hind femur 6 mm., width of head 6 mm., of abdomen 
7 mm. 
Body stout, nearly smooth, depressed. Head widest behind the middle across the 
rear of the broad eyes, abruptly sloping behind the eyes to the nearly straight, scurfy 
pubescent hind margin. Antennae slender hardly as long as the head, sparsely hairy toward 
the tip. Eyes directed iintero-laterally. 
Labium wide, thin; hinge reaching posteriorly as 
far as the mesothorax. 
Mentum with a very prominent and broad median lobe whose mar- 
gin is entire and nearly bare. 
Mental setae about 12 each side, the outer seven stronger. 
Lateral lobes broad, lateral setae 10, with a very minute axial seta or spiuule at base. Teeth 
on opposed margins of lateral lobes nearly obsolete, hut armed with about four graduated 
spinules each ; at the inner angle are a number of scattered stronger marginal spinules. 
Movable hook slender and setiform, nearly straight to the incurved tip. 
Legs slender, thinly hairy externally. Wing cases reaching posteriorly to the apex of 
'"ment. 
the 6th abdominal si__ 
Abdomen triquetral, with sharp lateral margins, the sides nearly parallel except at the 
ends, abruptly truncated in the rear, hardly narrowed before the 9th segment. Lateral 
spines on segments 8 and 9, straight and sharp, -with finely spin~~lose external margins, on 
8 half as long as the segment, on g full as long as the segment. Dorsal hooks on segments 
3-9, slender and straight and strongly directed posteriorly, longest on segment 7, where as 
long as that segment, diminishing in length toward both front and rear : 10th segment short 
and included in the apex of the 9lh. Appendages triquetrnl, hardly surpassing- the level of 
the tips of the spines of the 9th segment; superior and inferiors equal, the laterals hard1.v

The species falling in this subfamily are all smooth, highly polished, and are 
easily recognized by the short, globose, or subglobose, abdomen, the second 
segment being usually the largest, by the short thorax, the scutellum being convex 
and smooth, rarely foveated at base, and by the hind tibiae having only one apical 
spur. All the species are genuine parasites and destroy various Aphids (&h- 
didae). 
The group seems to form a connecting link between the Figitidae and the 
C'tzipidm, many of the species closely resembling those in the genera Ceroptres, 
ATezt~ote?~, Dyopha&a, etc.

is a most striking looking wasp on account of the shape of the head and the 
foliaceous dilations of the thorax and legs. Professor Westwood, uncertain whether 
it was a cynipid or a proctotrypid, finally placed it doubtfully among the latter in 
the subfamily Diaprtinae. 
Unlortunately, I have not yet had a specimen for examination, but, judging 
from Westwood's description and figure, and especially of the venation, I have very 
little doubt of its being a cynipoid and not a proctotrypoid, so for the present treat 
it as a tribe in the subfamily Xysfinae. 
Besides the foliaceous dilations on the pronolurii, femora and tibiae, it may be 
recognized by the following characters : - 
Wings well developed, with the venation distinct, the marginal cell large, as in 
Xystvs; head subglobose. with a short, porrect snout; antennae in Q 14-jointecl, 
filiform (8 unknown) . . Loboscelidia Westwood 
(Type L. rufescens Westw.) 
This tribe is distinguished by the head, thorax, and legs being normal, the 
pronotnm and legs always w;:'/ho/;/ foliaceous dilations. The antennae in the 
females are 12- or 13-jointed, in the males 13- or 14-jointed. 
The species are numerous and attack almost exclusively species belonging to 
the hon~opterous family Afiiicliilae.

To this family, as I have restricted it, belong all the genuine gall-makers, the 
gall-inhaling species (Synerginaej, and the Ibaliinae, the latter reprcscnting a small 
group of parasites. The gall-makers and gall-inhaling species are very numerous, 
, 
closely resemble each other, often living side by side together in the same galls, 
and are separated with difficulty, the experienced eye alone being able lo detect 
the difference. They produce galls or live in galls, on various trees and plants,

the oak, bramble, rose, and various Compositae being especially subject to their 
attacks. From the FigHidae they are distinguished principally by abdominal 
peculiarities, the tergites being shorter and not meeting along the venter, not 
enclosing or hiding the sternites, as in the former, except in some Anacharines. 
All, however, have a habitus or tout-eiisemfile peculiarly their own, which with 
practice one soon perceives, and is thus able to recognize the different groups at a 
glance. 
Three subfamilies have been recognized, distinguished by the characters 
employed in the following table : - 
Basal joint of hind tarsi usually shorter than joints 2-5 united or never much 
longer; abdomen not or very little longer than the head and thorax united 
.

Basal joint of hind tarsi at least twice as long as 2-5 united ; joints 2-4 scarcely 
longer than thick, the second with a long spined process outwardly . 
. 2 
I. Second segment in female very large, occupying the whole or nearly the whole 
surface of abdomen, very rarely showing an indistinct dividing suture; it this 
suture is distinct or complete it is very oblique and the segment dorsally is 
fully two thirds the length of the abdomen ; males with the second and third 
segments nearly equal, but here two segments occupy most of the surface of 
the abdomen; venter more or less covered basally Subfamily I. Synerginae 
Second segment in female much shorter, but the longest segment; the second 
and third together not occupying two thirds the whole surface or rarely; 
venter always visible . . . Subfamily 11. Cynipinae 
2. Abdomen very strongly compressed, cultriforin, and much longer than the 
head and thorax united, the four or five basal segments nearly of an equal 
length . . Subfamily III. Ibaliinae

PSYCHE [August 
be popularly known as "the false gall-makers " or Inquilines, since most of them, 
if not all of them, are not genuine gall-makers, although often mistaken for them ; 
nor are they genuine parasites, i. e. they do not destroy the genuine gall-makers; 
on the contrary all, with possibly two or three exceptions, are inquilines or commen- 
sals and merely dwell, often side by side, in the galls made by other insects. Most 
of them are bred from cynipidous galls, found on oak trees, but some are also bred 
from galls made by other insects, Diptera, etc., occurring on the oak, willow, ctc. 
The genus Symfhrus is said to be a genuine gall-maker as well as the genus 
Rhciopkilus, described from Africa 'and bred from a gall on Rhus; but, judging 
from the structural characters of these wasps I suspect both are really commensals 
in cynipidous and cecidomyidous galls.

cynipoids producing galls or deformations on various trees and plants. The genera 
and species are numerous, much more numerous than most people imagine, and 
undoubtedly many genera and species yet remain unknown to us. The National 
collection contains many undescribed species. 
The vast majority of the described species belonging to this subfamily produce 
galls on oak trees, and on the rose and bramble (blackberry and raspberry), but 
this is due probably to the fact that the galls made on these trees and plants are 
much more conspicuous, or the trees and plants themselves are more thoroughly 
studied, than those on other trees and plants, and when the galls on other trees 
and plants are more extensively collected and studied, we may expect a wonderful 
increase in our knowledge of the gall-making cynipoids. 
The subfamily Cynipi~/ae is dividable into five minor groups or tribes, which 
appear to be natural, since the species falling in each tribe confine their attacks to 
trees and plants of the same order or family, or closely allied orders or families. 
The species falling in the tribe C'ifini, for example, produce galls only on trees of 
the order CUPULIFERAE, those of the tribe Rhodiiini attack the ROSACEACKAE, those 
of the tribe Aulaciniattack the COMPOSITACEAE, etc. 
These tribes may be recognized by the use of the following table: - 
1 
Antennae inserted abnormally high up on the face on- an imaginary line drawn 
across from the apex of the eyes ; face with two short, distinct antennal fur- 
rows . 
5 
Antennae inscrtcd normally on or near the middle of the face, or far below an 
imaginary line drawn across from the apex of the eyes ; face without distinct 
antenna! furrows . 2 
2. Winged forms . 3 
Wingless or subaptcrous forms. 
These are all dimorphic or agarnous forms, represented only in the female sex ; 
they produced the fully winged sexual form represented by both sexes (8 9 ) 
and are easily recognized by the family characteristics, and produce galls on 
oak trees, or the C7<*diferae in late fall and winter. The sexual form appears 
in early spring and smiuner , . Tribe I. - Cynipini 
3. 
Cubitus in front wings wanting or if present originating distinctly below the mid- 
dle of the basal nervure; areolet often entirely absent; abdomen variable. 
Cubitus in front wings rarely entirely absent and originating at or near the 
middle of the basal nervure, never much below the middle; areolet usually

compressed, with the second segment always large, occup\ing usually about 
two thirds the whole surface of the abdomen, the hypopygium ending in a blunt

about two thirds the whole surface, the hypopygium prominent, acutely pointed

twice as long as thick. (Producing galls on rose-bushes, etc., Rosa and Rz;I,z;s.)

whole surface ; front wings with the areolet distinct, lying directly beneath the 
origin of the cubitus; third joint of antennae longer than the fourth. (Pro-

Tribe 111.- Pediaspiclini 
Abdomen with the second segment shortcr, occupying scarcely half the whole 
surface ; front wings with the areolet often wanting, or if present not lying 
directly beneath the origin of the radius, usually small ; third joint of antennae 
not or rarely longer than the fourth, usually shorter. (Producing galls on

(Producing galls on LEGL'MIKOSAE : Acacia.) . . Tribe V.- Eschatocerini 
This is the largest and most extensive tribe in the subfamily, and contains 
many genera and species, and all the species, without a single exception, produce 
galls on the mastworts (CUPULIFERAE), the oaks (QUERCUS) especially being most 
frequently subject to their attacks; it is extremely rare for them to attack the 
chestnut (CASTAREA), or the beech (FAGUS), although their galls are sometin~cs 
found on these trees, but the wasps producing them are seldom reared, and are 
still iindescribecl.

SYNOPSIS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES OF AMMOPHlLA. 
BY A. L. MELANDER, CHICAGO, JLL. 
Recently through the kindness of the authorities of the Academy of natural 
sciences of Philadelphia I had the opportunity of studying the types of AMMOPHILA 
contained in their collection. A synopsis of the species was arranged in tabular 
form with the intention of further work on the group. As this plan cannot, now 
be carried out it seems advisable to publish the notes made while in Philadelphia 
for the assistance of any who wish to study this interesting genus. In the original 
table have been interpolated the additional North American species not contained 
at the Philadelphia academy, their places having been determined from the descrip- 
tions alone. Owing to the incomplete diagnoses of some authors a number of these 
species have been placed out of their natural order, ancl hence the table is in part 
more artificial than is to be desired; but in the main a natural relationship is 
expressed. 
It is strange that the study of such large, common, ancl intelligent insects 
should have been so long neglected. Possibly this is due to the uncertainty in the 
determination of the species, of the older authors and to the confusion existing 
between the homonymous but different species of Dahlbo~n and Lepelctier. But 
as in the northeastern part of the United States the species are not numerous the 
student of at least that section sl~ould experience but little trouble in naming his 
captures. For example, some two hundred specimens collected by myself in central 
and southern Texas, Illinois, and New England yield only three PSAMMOPHILAS, 
nine AMMOPIIILAS and the one COLOPTERA, thirteen species, of which ten are found 
in the Northeastern States. 
In order of abundance of individuals these species 
are : frocera, ?I&-ricans, uw~aria, vwlaceipennis, extremiiata, i9iepta (Tex.), abbreuiafti, 
1'uJgaris, grossa (Tex.), ~~C~LOSIZ, yrac///s3 7tlrighiii ('rex.), and an unclescribed species 
from Illinois. 
It will he noticed that most of these are the species of the older 
authors. 
On account of thc brevity of their descriptions the determination of these 
can best be accomplished by eliminating the other species found in the type locality, 
By this method, and as they seem to be the most abundant forms, the older species 
can be readily fixed. A careful redescription of them is desired from the next 
monographer. 
A number of changes in nomenclature are instituted, whereby several well- 
known names are dropped as synonyms. The dubious violaceipennis is a common 
form of the United States, concerning'whose identity it is indeed strange that a 
doubt should ever have existed. 
The Brazilian urnaria of Lepeletier is not the 




================================================================================


same as Dahlbom's species; frocera Lep. is not prorera Dahlb., but is the other 
sex of his intercepts and both are synonyms of ti.igricans Dahlb.; bp-aci/is Cam. is 
not fi-adis Lep., while the Canadian form of same name seems to bc a third 
species. 
With such well-known and long established names as cementaria, grjIphzds, 
fracem, rob&, mam, aaomala, etc., untenable, the future student will hesitate 
before describing new species. However the Mexican and Central American spe- 
cies of Peter Cameron seem valid and in little danger of confluence. The stumbling 
block or the earlier describers has often been the association of the sexes, since a 
distinct dimorphism often prevails. Generally the males are more slender, more 
hirsute, and more brilliantly marked than the females, and in those species with the 
abdomen partially red the males frequently have the black encroaching dorsally 
as a median line. Their clasping sexual organs and the narrow and straight-sided 
face are distinctive of this sex. 
Of the species of the United States some difficulty might be experienced in 
differentiating between certain forms. 
For this reason a few supplementary notes 
on the common species are added : - 
vulgaris is a small species, about three fourths of an inch in length. 
The 
mesonotum of the female generally has a deep median furrow. Thc striae of the 
metanotum are close together, oblique and well-cut, and are generally connected by 
a median line. 
juncea is founded on a slender male with very fine transverse mctanotal striae. 
The central portion of the disc is sometimes confusedly punctate and slightly hairy. 
It is a larger form than valgaris. 
sfrema is about one inch in length and has complete transverse striae on the 
metanotum not quite so well marked as in vulyaris but rougher than injuncea. The 
anterior striae tend to become oblique. The female has a short narrow impressed 
line on the mesonotum. 
urnaria. 
The obsolete striate arrangement of the punctures near the tegulae 
is quite characteristic and fairly constant in this species. The rather coarse striae 
of the metanotum are more or less oblique and frequently become rugulose on the 
disc as in juncea. 
abbreviata is quite distinct among the local species by the acuminate clypeus 
of the male, the short pale golden macule of the inesopleurae, and the black 
abdomen. 
nz'picans also has the abdomen mostly black but the pleurae are entirely black 
and the wings darkened. 
extremitata is quite distinct by the yellowish wings. The thorax of the female 
is matte-black and the abdomen contains a brighter red than in the other common 
forms. 




================================================================================


158 PSYCHE [AU~USI 
procera is the only local species with complete and coarse transverse striae on 
the noturn. 
It is also the largest of our species, some specimens attaining nearly 
an inch and a half in length. 
It is believed that the following table will give a truthful determination of the 
species of this group as they have been defined, and since the species necd no 
longer be confused it is hoped that an interest in their study may be aroused. 
Especially to be desired is the observation of the habits of these intelligent wasps, 
-a pleasant research,- for the 
aininophiles are intellectually superior to the 
other fossorial Hymenoptera, as the entertaining records of Fabre, the Peckhams, 
Williston, and others have shown.

i'HE NORTH AMERICAN ANTS OF THE GENUS STENAMMA 
SENSE STRICT0.I 
BY WILLIAM MORTOX WHEELER, AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, NEW 
YORK., N. Y. 
There is a good deal of confusion in regard to the two described North 
American species of STENAMMA sensii stricto, owing to imperfect knowledge of the 
sexual forms of one of the species. Stenamma warcticwz was described by Mayr 
from two male and two female specimens taken towards the end of October in 
California. To the same species he referred two workers, one frdin New Haiup- 
Contributious from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Texas, Yo. 51. 




================================================================================


shire and one from Virginia. 
Later he withdrew the description of the workers 
and left the species to rest on the descriptions of the winged forms alone. The 
other species (S. brmicorne Mayr) was described at length from worker and female 
specimens taken in Virginia. 
In his revision of the North American STENAMMA, Emery regarded marcticum 
as a subspecies of the European S. westwoodi, and referred to this same form his 
own subspecies diecki with its variety impressurn. 
More recently Forel has again revised the species, prefacing his conclusions 
with the following remarks: "This subgenus (STEKAMMA seas. sir.) presents an 
almost inextricable tangle of allied forms. The sculpture of the American species 
is denser than that of S. westwoodiof Europe. 1 believe that they should be 
separated specifically, if only for the sake of unravelling the tangle. On the 
other hand, I doubt whether S. diecki Emery really belongs to nearcticum and 
believe that it belongs rather to b~e7x"orne. Emery gives the differential char- 
acters between the American workers and the typical Weshuoodi but not between 
the 
workers of nmrcticwn and hwicorne. Now the fundamental difference between 
these two species lies in the wings, and none of the specimens described by Emery 
as nm?-cficum, diecki, etc., seem to have possessed these appendages, as the author 
makes no mention of them. It seems to me more prudent, therefore, since the 
winged sexes are so little known, to retain the name nearctimm only for the female 
and male described by Mayr and to consider all the other American forms as 
races or varieties of In'evicorne till we have proof of the contrary." 
After examining considerable material of STENAMMA from different parts of 
the United States, from Connecticut to Washington, I am abie to establish the 
truth of Professor Forel's conjecture. Among this material a single male and 
female collected at Corvallis, Oregon, and sent me by Mr. J. C. Bradley, are 
without question referable to Mayr's warfiic-um. These specimens are veiy dark, 
with conspicuous apterostigma, and with the same neuration as the European 
westwoo~z'~, i. e., the inner branch of the cubital vein comes off cit the cross-vein. 
The males and females of all the other North American forms in my possession 
(including diecki Emery i) have the inner branch of the cubital vein arising from 
the ?aid//Ze of the culiital cell, and therefore undoubtedly belong to 6revicorne Mayr, 
as Fore1 lias conjectured. Emery was evidently puzzled by the sculpture of the 
postpetiole. This is rough and opaque in brtvico7-iu' s. sf?.., but smooth and 
shining in some of the subspecies, like dsa'ki. As he had no winged specimens of 
this subspecies he was thus led to assign it to we~~7~~~1odii 
The synonymy of the two species, as I understand it. should therefore stand as 
follows :

A fine colony of the typical hrevicorm, comprising all three phases was sent 
me by Mr. C. E. Brown, who found it under a stone at North Milwaukee, Wis., 
May 1 ~th, 190 r. At Rockforcl, Ill., I have taken several colonies of this form, 
rarely under stones, but most frequently under the thick layer of dead leaves and 
vegetable mould which accumulates in rich, clamp woods. In this locality I did 
not see the winged sexes till July 25th-Aug. 19th. The early capture of these 
by Mr. Brown would seem to indicate that they sometimes pass the winter in a 
virgin state in the parental nest, 
The colonies are always very small, comprising not more than 20-60 workers 
and very often even less. They resemble colonies of I-EPTOTHORAX, especially 
when they are found, as is sometimes the case, nesting in hollow acorns embedded 
in the vegetable mould. The species is very timid, and apparently either nocturnal 
or subterranean in its habits. This seems to be indicated by the coloration, the 
small size of the eyes in the workers, and by the fact that I have never seen these 
insects moving about on the surface of the ground even on dark, cloudy days. 
They probably feed on small larvae and other animal food. S. treviforns, like 
5. nearcticitm, is a sub-boreal form and has not been found up to the present time in

collccted for me in the high mountains of New Mexico by Prof. and Mrs. T. D. A. 
Cockerel!. 
The subspecies ifiecki also occurs at Rockford under the dead leaves in the 
very same localities as the typical brevicurne. Often the nests of the two forms are 
located only a few feet from each other. The winged sexes of diecki are recorded 
in my notes as occurring from Aug. r;,tl1-19th. They are decidedly smaller than 
the corresponding- sexes of the typical form, and the male is paler, with colorless 
wings and paler legs and antennae. I could detect no differences in habits between 
die& and the typical brevicorne.

It does not even occur among the fine lot of ants kindly 
collected for me in the high mountains of New Mexico by Prof. and Mrs. T. D. A. 
Cockerell. 
The subspecies diecki also occurs at Rockford under the dead leaves in the 
very same localities as the typical breviwrne. Often the nests of the two forms are 
located only a few feet from each other. The winged sexes of diecki are recorded 
in my notes as occurring from Aug. r 5th-I 9th. 
They are decidedly smaller than 
the corresponding sexes of the typical form, and the male is paler, with colorless 
wings and paler legs and antennae. I could detect no differences in habits between 
die& and the typical bn-vicorne.

PSYCHE. 
A REVIEW OF FHE NOR1 13 AMERICAS SPECIES OF 
N EMOTELUS. PLATE 4. 
BY AXEL LEONARD MELANDER, CHICAGO, ILI 
The genus NF.MOTF.I.US, or NEXATOTELUS, includes a group of rather small 
Stratiomyiidae generally of dark coloration, characterized by the prolongation of the 
lower part of the face. From the underside of this rostellum projects the slender 
and long drawn-out proboscis which has gained the generic name for these insects. 
However instead of being used as a weapon these mouth parts are admirably 
adapted For their function of lcediug from the long throated florets of the cone- 
flowers. These small flies are not rare ; where they occur they can be caught by 
dozens from the heads of their favorite flowers. From the few published records 
concerning this genus it would seem that in the Eastern States N. carfionarizt~ is 
the most abundant. Jn Illinois N. unicolor is the prevailing form. 
This species 
also, has the greatest distribution, occurring to Hayti and Mexico. 
Nemotehis 
canadensis is commonest in Colorado, N. crassus in Kansas, while the Texas 
species are all equally abundant. 
The European species of this genus have been divided into three groups by 
Dr. H. Loew, as follows : - 
I. All the tibiae in part black, 
2. Hind tibiae only in part black, 
3. All the tibiae with almost no black. 
On this basis the North American species would be grouped thus : - 
Of these groups the first seems incongruous, but the other two are well con- 
structed. 
The species of the second have black males, stubby faces, and as a 




================================================================================

whole occur inland. 
The third, however, is a maritime group. The males have 
white abdomens and the faces are produced and pointed. 
NemoteZ'uspa//ipes Say 
is an anomalous species of the group. 
It is interesting to note that apparently so 
trivial a character as the relative extent of the dark color on the tibiae should be 
correlated with much more striking differences. Another remarkable correlation 
was noticed for the species in the collection. Those with black males (AT unicolor, 
crasszis, carbotmriz~r, canadcns$ and orator) have the third vein of the wings sim- 
ple; those species whose males have whitish abdomens have the third vein fur- 
cate (A? wiheekri, trinotatus, and b~llz~lus). Nemotelus trziesii, however, is anonlalous 
in this as well as in other respects. With this division in mind Mr. C. W. Johnson 
was asked to furnish data from the types of his species. Ncmatelns i-mmaculatus 
is injured, but N. sZossonae and fiavicornis have the third vein simple. Although 
these species have the abdomen white, it is nevertheless marked with a blackish 
design. 
We shall look forward with interest for an 
account of this characteristic 
in the other species. 
In the preparation of this paper I have had access to the Hough collection of 
the University of Chicago. 
My own material supplemented by specimens from Dr. 
Wm. M. Wheeler has been of the greatest use. 
In conclusion I wish to thank Mr. 
Charles W. Johnson of Boston for his assistance in furnishing literature not access- 
ible in Chicago and for the information regarding the types of his species.

antennae reddish beneath and the knob of the halteres blackish. All the other

A? unicolor the form referred by van der Wulp to nigrimts Fallen ? The dcscrip- 
Lions of the European species apply very well to the North American specimens. 
A single specimen in the Hough collection taken in Hayti seems closely related 
to N. unicohr. Were it not for the extended distribution of this species and the 
fact that the Glen Ellyn specimen of unicolor represents a similar variation, the 
West Indian example might be considered another species. Its peculiarities are 
the following: thorax with a black bronzed tinge; antennae brownish basally; 
face short; in length less than the width of the eye; length 2.25 mm. See figure. 
The specimen scarcely seems to be the female of any of the three species occurring 
within its geographical range, (2% imacula-fm, sZossonae,$avico~eis.)

I 86 PSYCHE [Oct. - Dec. 
THE RE-DISCOVERY OF PHILORUS (BLEPHAROCERA) YOSEMITE 
OSTEN SACKEN, 
BY VERNON L. KELLOGG, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CAL. 
About 3 P. M. on June 6, 1876, Baron von Osten Sacken caught three flying 
male Blepharocerid flies "on the bridle-path to the foot of the Upper Yosemite 
Fall." From these specinlens he described the new species B?epharocem j~osemife, 
and since that time no further records of the capture of representatives of the 
species have been made, This last summer, while tramping and climbing in the 
Sierra Nevadas, I took occasion to visit the " bridle-path to the foot of the Upper 
Yosemite Fall " with Osten Sacken's twenty-five years gone capture in mind, but 
there were no delicate-winged B. yosemite hovering by the path side. About sixty- 
miles farther south, however, in another great Californian flat-floored, vertical 
walled gorge, the Grand Canyon of the King's River, I found the larvae and pupae 
of a Blepharocerid species new to me, which prove, on dissection of the well formed 
adults from the pupal cases, to be the immature stages of Osten Sacken's Yosemite 
species. I have before me males and females (taken from the pupal cases), larvae 
and pupae, so another gap in our knowledge of the Blepharocerid fauna is filled in. 
These larvae and pupae were taken July 15, 1903, from the smooth, sub- 
merged surfaces of great granite blocks fallen into a swift little clear-water stream 
called Granite Creek, from a vertical cliff-side lifting three thousand.feet above. In 
the relation of their home stream to the great mountains, in all their environment, 
they might as well have been in the Yosemite Valley in the stream which falls 1600 
feet over a cliff's verge to make the Upper Yosemite Fall. The two great canyons, 
that of the Merced (the Yosemite) and that of the King's, have the same relative 
relation to the main crest of the Sierra Nevada, the same altitude, the same con- 
ditions of temperature and moisture, the same geology and botany and zoology. 
The imagines (dissected from pupal cases) show exactly the characteristic 
venation as described by Osten Sacken, which I have taken to be diagnostic of 
the genus PhZIoms (see my "Net-winged Midges of North America," No. XXX of 
Contrib. to biol. from the Hopkins seaside laboratory, 1903). 
As Ostcn Sacken had 110 female specimen and thus could not say whether the 
separated and dissected eyes of the male were characteristic of both sexes I record 
here the fact that in the female the eyes are broadly separated and also distinctly 
bisected (that is, divided by a line into an upper, light brown part, being about 3 
of the whole eye, composed of large ommatidia, and a lower, blackish brown part 
composed of smaller ommatidia).

The pupae differ from those of all other Blepharocerid species known to me in 
having the dorsal prothoracic respiratory flaps contiguous ; they are distinctly apart 
in all other known pupae. The larvae more nearly resemble those of Bibiocephala 
covnstocki Kelt. (a species common in the Santa Cruz Mountains of the San Fran- 
cisco peninsula) than those of any other species, having the lateral processes in 
much the same condition. The! differ noticeably, however, in being much darker

Mr. Babcuck was throughout -A long and active life an entl~usiastic collector of natuial history

and curios from every quarter of the globe. Attracted strongly by the beaut} of birds and 
butterflies he directed his energies chiefly to these groups, especially in his earlier ?c;ii 5. 
Accompanied by his wife lie spent several monll~s in the winter of 1872-3 in British Guiana, 
collecting in the vicinity of Georgetown and among the Indian villages of the interior along 
the Essequibo river. 
The winter ol 1879-80 uas spent in a similar trip to Florida. 
During later years he had devoted his time chiefly to insects and by collerfing and 
exchanges had secured a large amount of material. 
Of the local fauna he had paid most 
attention in these Inter Years to tlic Oilonata. and several collections we the richer for his

Mr. Babcock WEIS throughout a long and active life an enthusiaslic collector of natural history 
specimens, devoting his energies chiefly to forming an extensive private collection of animals 
and curios from every quarter of the globe. Attracted strongly by the beauty of birds and 
butterflies he directed his encrgies chiefly to these groups, especially in his earlier yeais. 
Accompanied by his wife he spent several months in the winter of 1872-3 in British Guiana, 
collecting in the vicinity of Georgetown and among the Indian villages of the interior along 
t.he Essequibo river. 
The winter of 1879-80 was spent in a similar trip to Florida. 
During later years he had devoted his time chiefly to insects and by collecting and 
exchanges had secured a large amount of material. 
Of the local fauna he had paid "most 
attention in these later Fears to the Oiloiiala, and several collections Eire the richer for his 
efforts in this direction. Efiallagma~ictum was described from material in his collection 
and the types were donated by him to the Museum of compnrative zoology. 
Mr. Bahcock, while hampcrcd exceedingly by lack of means and early advantages, 
possessed energy, enthusiasm, and perseverance to a notable degree, and a lover of nature 
was always sure of his interest and encouragement. It is to be hoped that his collection 
may remain intact as a fitting ~noniiinent to his inUi~.ina; efforts and singleness of aim.-

PS YCHE [Oct. - Dec. 
THE TIPULID HYPOPYGIUM, A STUDY IN SPECIFIC 
ADAPTATIONS. 
BY ROBERT E. SNODGRASS, STANFORD UNIVERSITY. CAL. 
A detailed study of the terminal abdominal segments of the males and females 
of the Tipuliclae shows an enormous amount of variety in the hypopygial parts of 
the males, and, in striking contrast, a uniform simplicity of structure in the corre- 
sponding parts of the females. The writer has made such a study on a large num- 
ber of Tipulid species in the entomological collection of the Washington Agricul- 
tural College, identified by Mr. R. W. Doane. The detailed descriptions and 
figures are comprised in two papers not yet published, but some facts of general 
interest are here given. 
The term " hypopygium " may be most conveniently limited to the ninth abclom- 
inal segment of the male. This is the genital segment, i. e., the one that in all 
insects carries the intromittent organ and usually the clasping appendages. 
The Tipulid hypopygium is in general cup-shaped with the opening posterior. 
The cavity of the cup is the genital chamber and is produced simply by the invagi- 
nation of the posterior face of the 
segment. This necessarily carries into the 
genital chamber the tenth or anal segment which, morphologically, terminates the 
abdomen. Attached to the posterior rim of the hypopygium are, on each side, 
from one to three clasping lobes, called the apical apjendages. The body of the 
segment is composed of four plates -one dorsal, one ventral, and two lateral. The 
dorsal and ventral plates are evidently the tergum and sternum respectively,,while 
the lateral ones may be termed the pleural plates on account of their position. In 
the lower genera they have strictly a pleural position, but in the higher genera they 
may be simply set into the posterior rim of the segment, or exsertecl upon the pos- 
terior margin, or they may be lacking entirely. They always, however, when pres- 
ent, bear the apical appendages. According to the structure of the pleura the 
relationships of the larger groups within the family and the evolution of the genera 
from one another may be nicely traced. 
Within the genital chamber and arising from its floor or anterior wall lies the 
penis, a straight or curved rod-like tube. Its terminal part is always protected by 
a chitinous guard arising from the posterior part of the floor of the genital chamber. 
Now, although the larger groups within the family are separable on a basis of 
modifications in the more fundamental parts of the hypopygium, the other parts, 
such as the apical lobes, the penis, and the guard of the penis, present a11 infinite 
number of specific variations. No two species, no matter how similar otherwise, 
were found to be even nearly identical in the structure of these parts. 




================================================================================


Turning now to the females we find less variety in the terminal parts of the 
abdomen 
throughout the entire family than may characterize the males of one 
genus. 
'I'he female parts are constructed as follows: The eighth sternum is pro- 
longed far back of the eighth tergum, and is terminated by two elongate append- 
ages set on edge beside each other. The ninth segment is much smaller in cliam- 
eter than the eighth, and consists of a narrow ring of chitin. The tenth segment 
is generally elongate and terminates in two usually long and tapering cerci. The 
dorsal side of the eighth sternum is concave and the concavity is covered above 
by the ventral parts of the ninth and tenth segments. Rudimentary gonapopl~yses 
are present in the form of small plates or bars of chitin on the upper side of the 
eighth sternum and on the opposed ventral side of the ninth. 
Within the group 'I'ipulina the female genital parts differ almost exclusively in 
the form of the rudimentary gonapophyscal plates, and usually only the tips of 
these project as free processes. On the other hand, the modifications of the male 
parts within this group are excessive. Within the other groups the genera are 
characterized by slightly varying shapes of the external female parts, but in none is 
there any variety comparable with that existing between the males. 
In other words, it is impossible to point ott any correlation between the great 
variations of the male hypopygia and the extremely slight modifications of the 
female genitalia. 
How, then, are we to explain the origin of the former ? 
Tf the 
modifications in the structure of the body of the hypopygium, the varieties in size 
and shape of the guard of the penis and the clasping apical appendages are not 
adaptive, why do they exist? 'She conclusion seems to be unavoidable that some 
other cause for specific variety must be operative here than that of adaptation to 
the female organs. Thai the more fundamental modifications of the hypopygium 
had an early origin in the evolution of the family is evinced by the fact that they 
are characteristic of the larger groups intu which the family has been separated on 
other characters. 
It is such a common method of explanation in the case of specific variations 
such as one meets with in these Tipuh'cl hypopygia, to assume that they are adap- 
tive, that it is interesting, to see how such explanations may fail to be substantiated 
when tests are actually made. It can, of course, he said that our lmo'ivledge of 
the physiology of the parts is insufficient, and that on this account nicely balanced 
interrelations are not perceived. A failure to disprove, however, is not a proof of 
the opposite, and no one can ever say of anything that his knowledge of it is 
complete.

two forms. 
Dr. Hulsl placed them in separate genera, but he differentiates these 
genera only in that HYDRIOMENE has the thorax tufted posteriorly while COE- 
NOCALPE is not so. Now several C. mafnoliafo from Maine, New York, and New 
Jersey before me have fully as large thoracic tufts as Hulsl's type of H.pernotata. 
and some of these specimens have been labeled C. niagiinhaSa for me by Dr. EIulst. 
Therefore I would transfer C. magnoliafa to HYDRIOMENE and place H. pernotata 
Hulst as a synonym of it. Henry Edwards is credited with a description of the

Rossland, B. C., does not show a fovea below on the fore wings while it does on 
the hind wings and it would therefore seem that the species, while a pod one, 
should be placed in DEILIKIA rather than in CYMATOPHORA. Hulst had no male in

TWO NEW SPECIES OF SPHEX. 
BY H. T, FERNALD, PIT. T)., AMHERST, MASS. 
SPHEX NUDUS, sp. nov. 
Head. 
Black, covered with long ycllowish white hairs, 
Clypeus and frons covered 
with pale straw-colored pubescence to, or slightly above the insertion of the antennae, except 
at middle of anterior edge of clypeus where it hardly reaches the edge. A noticeable furrow 
passes forward (downward) a short distance, from the median ocellus. Surface of from with 
rather coarse, scattered punctures. Mandibles black at base and from the bases of the two 
teeth to their lips; elsewhere ferruginous. Antennae black, third segment longest; scape 
with short, pale straw-colored hairs. 
Thorax. 
Collar with faint scattered punctures and a few pale hairs; with a trace of 
yellowish white pubescence on its dorsal edge. 
Prothoracic lohe black, posterior portion 
somewhat pubescent, fringed behind with pale hairs. Just behind the lobe is a vertical band 
of pale yellowish pubescence more or less pronounced. Mesonoturn somewhat punctured, 
with short grayish white hairs, and a faint median longitudinal groove on its anterior third. 
Scutellum rather more sparsely and finely punctured, with a slight median depression, and 
covered with short, grayish white hairs. Postscutelluin pale ycllowish white pubescent as 
far laterally as where the groove of the median segment leading- to the stigma originates. 
This pubescence is frequently in part or entirely absent. Median segment finely, trans- 
verselv aciculaLe, covered with yelloivish white hairs longer than those of Lhe mesonotutn 
and scntellu~n. Above the petiole are two yellowish white pubescent areas partly confluent 
on the median line. 
Petiole short, straight, black, with yellowish white hairs. 
. Abdomen. Above, smooth, gray sericeous, very faintly punctured, the lust two seg- 
ments henring grayish and brownish hairs directed backwards. 
Terminal segment rounded, 
somewhat compressed on its posterior half at the sides, forming a slight median ridge (Fig. 
-6). Beneath, glistening, somewhat sericeous, with a few scattered grayish hairs, which on 
the fifth, sixth, and seventh ventral plates become tuft$, one on each side, on each of the 
segments named. Eighth segment somewhat ernarginate on its hinder border. Ninth 
(terminal) segment rounded at the sides, with a spine on the posterior edge (Fig. 4) giving 
this plate the same form as that found in Spltexflavipcs. 
Wings. 
Nearly hyaline, the front. pair very slightly fuscous. Tegulae black, margins 
dull ferrugir~ous ; traces of a yellowish pubescence present. 
Legs. Tibiae and tarsi yellow ferruginous except last tarsal segment and claws which 
are much darker or almost black. 
Spines of legs yellow ferruginous. Coxae, Irochanters, 
and the greater portion of femora black, the tips of the latter yellow ferruginous. 
Coxae 
sparsely punctured, sericeous, with a few scattered hairs. 
Length, 18-22 mm. 
Described from six male specimens : one taken in Tenn., now in the collection 
of the U. S. national museum ; the others captured Aug. 23, 1902, at Indian Head, 
Md., by Mr. J. C. Bridwell on flowers of Monwda punctata L., and now in the col-

provides a ready means of separation. 
Though well clothed with hair the general effect to the eye is that of absence of 
such clothing. 1 am of the opinion thai the next species may prove to be the 
other sex of this, being" represented by females only, and a number having been 
taken at the same time and place. Until this relation can be proved however, 
they must remain separate.

than the scutelhim. 
Median segment finely, transversely aciculate, quite closely covered 
at the sides cincl behind with long- yellowish white hairs but with no trace of pubescence 
except a small pale yellow spot on each sidc just above the petiole, not alwa?s present. 
Petiole black, short, straight.

These two segments also hear short brownish hairs. 
Bcneath, glistening, 
with extremely minute punctures and here and there a larger one anteriorly. These become 
more abundant posteriorly and are quite numerous on the last two segments. 
This distribu-

Length. 22-25 mm. 
Described from six female specimens : one from the U. S. national museum, 
without locality; one from the American entomological society, collected in Ga. ; 
three collected at Indian Head, Md., Aug. 23, 1902, on Monardapunctata L., by 
Mi-. J. C. Bridivell for whom I take pleasure in naming the species; and one from 
Mcl. now in the collection of the Massachusetts agricultural college. I have also 
seen ten other specimens from the same localities, with one exception which was 
collected June 20, 1883 at New Orleans, La. 
The two species above described in many ways resemble Sphexflavipr:~ Sm. 
and have in some cases been mistaken for it. Of .S. ~zi~dus only males are known 
and these may be distinguished from males of S.flavipes by the differences of form 
of the last dorsal abdominal segment (Figures 2 and 6) and by the wings of the 
former being hyaline, while in the latter they are usually fuscous. Sphex b~idrie!Zi 
of which only Iemales are known, may be distinguished from females of S.flm~pes 
by the almost total absence of pubescence, giving the body a pronounced black 
appearance, and by the presence in the hind wing of S. flavipes of a short vein 
which leaves the cubital vein and enters the median cell just beyond the point 
where the discoidal vein leaves the cubital vein. No such hook-like vein is prcsent

in the specimens of S. b~idwelli but is seen in all the specimens of 5. flavipes

Whether this hook-like vein is a universal character of 
S.flavipes I cannot say, but I do not find it mentioned in any of the descriptions 
of this insect. 
(See Figs. I and 3.) 
It is probable that the name Sphex flavipes Sm. will need to be replaced by 
another, as this name was used by Fabricius much earlier for a different insect, 
which brings the present S. flavipes under the last portion of Canon XXXIII of 
the A. 0. U. Code.

19031 WHKELER:- CERAPACHYS AUGUSTAE 205 
SOME NOTES ON THE HABITS OF CE~APACHYS AUGUSTAE. 
BY WILLIAM MORTOX WHEELER, NEW YORK, N. Y. 
A year ago [ described in the Biological bulletin (Vol. 3, No, 5, Oct. 1902, 
p. 18 1-19 I) a singular Texan ant (Cer@achys [Par~~yscid\ augustae, of all known 
New World Formicidae the most primitive and generalized. The few specimens 
that furnished the types of the species were found under circumstances precluding 
a study of their habits. These, however, must be more thoroughly known before 
the precise taxonomic affinities of the tribe Cerapachyi to the Dorylinae and Po- 
nerinae can be determined. I was well pleased. therefore, during the past spring 
to happen on another larger living colony of these extremely rare ants together with 
their eggs, and to be able to study their behavior for several days in an artificial 
iiest. unfortunately, these ants, like their allies, the Ponerinae and Dorylinae in 
general, do not thrive so well in confinement as the more highly specialized and 
plastic Myrmicinae and Camponotinae. Hence my observations proved to be 
rather fragmentary, but 1 have seen fit, nevertheless, to record them because they 
shed some light on the habits and development of the Cerapachyi and thus bring 
us a step nearer to a determination of their natural affinities. 
The colony of C. augustae, on which the following observations were made, 
was discovered May 6th, 1903, near high water mark in the bottom of Shoal Creek 
at Austin, Texas. It was inhabiting a simple, straight gallery about 5 cm. long by 
7 mm. in diameter, under the very center of a large block of limestone. At one 
end the gallery dipped down into the soil to a depth of 4 cm. The ants, 29 in 
number, were all congregated in the surface gallery with their long bodies wrapped 
about a large packet of eggs. only workers were found, though careful search was 
made for the peculiar wingless female described in my former paper. The whole 
colony, with the possible exception of a few ants that may have been out foraging, 
was captured and placed in a small Petri dish, tlie bottom of which had been pro- 
vided with a thin layer of damp soil partly covered with a glass microscope slide. 
The ants soon took up their abode under the slide after collecting their scattered 
eggs. Nymphs of two common Texan termites (Amiimes tubiformans and Euter- 
mes cinereus) were cut into a few pieces and given them as food. Even when these 
were placed only a few millimeters from the ants, the latter showed no signs of 
noticing them till they were actually touched with the antennae. And even then 
the ants often hesitated before attacking the still struggling heads and thoraces. 
Iiventually the termites were dispatched by the ants curling about them and using 
both mandibles and sting. 
The latter produced sudden paralysis. 
Then the ants 
eagerly lapped up the juices exuding from the cut ends of the termite fragments,

while remaining very quiet as if absorbed in the delight of feeding. 
The mandi- 
bles seemed to be too feeble to cut or puncture even so thin a chitinous invest- 
ment as that of the termites. 
The antennae are undoubtedly the most important and remarkable organs of 
Cerafiachyx. This is shown by their great thickness (whence the name of the genus), 
the differentiation of the glancliform terminal joint of the flagellum, and their sin- 
gular Ireedom of movement. This freedom is permitted by the clypcus which is 
much compressed laterally in the form of a vertical crest, and does not overlap the 
scapes on the sides. The antennae are, in fact, kept in continual vibration in a 
plane perpendicular to the head with their elbows uppermost and not directed sick- 
wise as in other ants, while tlie glandiform joint of the flagellum plays over the 
surfaces with which it comes in contact. The insects must be guided almost exclu- 
sively by the contact-odor sense in these organs since they have no trace of eyes. 
Pronounced negative heliotaxis, evidently depending on some pliotodermatic sense. 
was apparent when the ants were exposed to the sun, though they did not respond 
very readily to the lower intensities of diffuse day-light. Strangely enough, this neg- 
ative heliotaxis was not associated with a high degree 
of positive thigmotaxis, as it is in many other insects, 
since the animals showed no decided tendency to con- 
ceal themselves with their bodies applied to the earth 
or glass. Often the whole colony would lie exposed 
for hours on the surface of the soil, meiely aggloiri- 
eratecl in a mass about their eggs. 
As the number of eggs visibly increased during 
tlie confinement of the colony, it is clear that some of 
these must have been laid by the workers, as there was 
no female in the nest. No ants conld be more careful 
of their eggs. They enveloped them with their bodies 
so that the packet could not be seen except by clistui-b- 
ing the whole colony. When the packet was broken 
apart the eggs were eagerly sought and deftly brought 
together again. This brooding over the eggs is quite 
unlike anything I have seen in other ants except Eciton, 
the smaller species of which (E. opac///;orax, schmifti, 
siim/chrasfi, etc.) have a very similar habit. Besides 
affording protection to the eggs, it may, perhaps, serve 
to hasten the embryonic development. 
The eggs are very slender (Figure, a), 
being fully four times as long as broad. 
They are not kept in several packets 
with the long axis of the component eggs parallel with one another, as in some 




================================================================================


Ponerinae (Lcptogenys, Piichycondyla), but without any definite orientation in a 
single su11sphe1-ical mass. The first eggs did not hatch till May 14tl1, showing 
that the incubation period must exceed eight days. They hatched rather slowly, a 
few at a time. 
The larvae (Figure, 6) were extremely slender, not twice as broad behind as 
at the anterior end, with well-marked segmental constrictions. The head is pro- 
portionately large, with strong, acute mandibles projecting- beyond the clypeal and 
labial regions. The maxillae are furnished with a pair of prominent sensory 
papillae and the labium with a well-developed duct to the spinning glands. The 
dorsal surface of the head as well as the whole surface of the body is covered uni- 
formly with short, slightly curved hairs. There are no traces of tubercles of any 
description. Attempts to observe the method employed by the ants in feeding 
their larvae were unsuccessful. Once, on placing a number of eggs and young 
larvae of Camponotus festinatus in the nest, I saw the young Cerapachys larvae 
feeding on the former after they had been carried under the slide by .the workers. 
It was apparent also that the ants and their older larvae soon began to feed on the 
unhatched eggs and younger larvae of their ow11 species, for the number of progeny 
decreased rapidly from day to day. In order to reduce the size of the colony and 
thus save as many o[ the young as possible from destruction, I killed and removed 
twelve of the workers May 17th. 1 was not successful, however, in stopping the 
infanticides, so on the following day 1 removed six more workers. By this time, 
however, though I had provided the nest daily with fresh termite food (the ants 
would not eat sweets, larvae of other ants, or miscellaneous insects) the Cerapachys 
became so demoralized that by May 19th no eggs and only five half-grown larvae 
remained. These larvae were carried by the ants after the manner of Eciton and 
Leptogenys, i. e. by the neck, with the long slender body extending back between 
the legs of the worker. The ants were quite as careful of their larvae as of their 
eggs. 
To my intense cliscippointment, it soon became manifest that I should be 
unable to rear the few remaining larvae to the pupal stage. I therefore killed the 
surviving workers and the three lanvc still uneaten May 20th. Thus I was unable 
to settle two important questions : first, the method of feeding the larvae, whcther 
by regurgitation or with pieces of insect food; and, second, the character or the 
pupa, whether naked or covered with a cocoon. The powerful development of the 
larval jaws would seem to indicate that the young are fed with pieces of insect 
food, and from the tact that the laival spinning glands'seem to be well developed, 
one may infer that the pupa is cncloscd in a cocoon. Whoever is so fortunate as 
to happen on a colony ol these ants during the middle or latter part of June will 
probably be able to determine the pupal characters without difficulty, as the pupae 
should at that time be found in the nests.

208 PSYCHE [~ct.- ~ec. 
What light do these few observations, together with those recorded in my pre- 
vious paper, shed on the affinities of the Cerapachyi to the Ponerinae on the one 
hand and the Dorylinae on the other? It is clear that the following trails of C. 
augitstae are decidedly Ponerine :- 
I. This ant lives in small colonies like the Ponerinae (Stigmatomma, Ponera, 
etc.) and not in pop~tlous colonies like the Dorylinae. 
2. 
Its nest has a very simple structure like that of the Ponerinae. 
3. 
The colonies are stationary like the Ponerinae and not nomadic like the 
Dorylinae. 
In confinement, at least, C. uz~gustae made no attempts to leave the 
nest and showed none of the singular restlessness which characterizes confined 
colonies of Eciton, but behaved like the home-loving species of Ponera, Lep- 
togenys, Pachycondyla, etc.1 
4. C. aupustae exhibits the same slow, monotonous, and timid behavior as the 
Ponerinae (Stigmatomma e. g.) in marked contrast to the intrepid, predatory 
instincts of the Dorylinae. 
5. The female of the Texan Cerapachys is not dichthadiiform, i. e. shaped like 
the huge wingless females of Dorylus and Eciton, but resembles the workers in 
form and stature. Some species of Cerapachys are known to have winged females. 
6. The workers are all very nearly of the same size and structure and in these 
respects resemble the workers of the Ponerinae. There is no tendency to poly- 
morphism as in Dorylus and Eciton. 
7. The petiole and post-petiole resemble the corresponding parts of certain 
Ponerinae (Stigmatomma, ctc.) . 
A fine colony of Ecifon sckmiffi which I kept a few years ago, exhibited this restlessness in a striking and ludi- 
c manner. The colony was at first confined in a tall glass jar on a sqmi-re board surrounded by ;i water moat. 
TIE 
ants kept ping up and down the inside of the jar'in files for many houis. Finally I removed the lid. The file at once 
advanced over the rim and descended on the outer surface till it reached the circular base of the jar where it turned to the 
left at a right angle and proceeded completely around the base rill it met the column at the tnmingpoint. To my su~prisc 
it kept right on over lhe same circwnference d~icl~ was long enough to accotnnmdate the whole colony. The ants contin- 
uedgoing round andround the circular base of the jar, following one another like so many sheep, without the slightest 
inkling that they were perpetually traversing the same path. They behaved exactly as they do on one uf their predatory 
expeditions. They kept up lhis gyration roi- 46 Ihuurs belore the column broke and spread over the hoard to the water's 
edge and clustered in the manner so characteristic of this and the allied species (E. opacifhwax, sumichrasii, etc.). I 
have never seen a more astonishing exhibition of the limitations ( gemanice " Bornirthcit") of instinct. For nearly 
two whole days tlieae blind creatures, so dependent on the contacl-odor sense of their antennae, kept palpitating their 
uniformly smooth, odoriferous trail and the a-dvanciiip- bodies of the ants immediately preceding them, without perceiving' 
that they were making no progress bnt only wasting their energy, till the spell was finally broken by some more ventwc- 
some memlxrs of the colony, Recently I have found a renmrk~~ble observalion of the same kind recorded by Fabre in 
the 6th volume of his incompaiable "Souvenirs Entotnolofiiqaea." He desciibes an army of caterpillars of the " proms- 
ionnaire du pin" (Cnethocampa pityocampa) going round and round the outside of a large vase 1.35 m. in circumference 
for seven days! During this period the caterpillars were on the march S-iliours altogether, slopping to rest on their path 
only when overtaken by the cold, and not actually deviating till the eighth day. Fabre estimated that the caterpillars. 
wled around the vase 333 times! In this case the insects were not guided by contact-odor like the Ecitons, but by the 
dkeu thread spun by each individual over the surface traversed. 




================================================================================


8. The eggs are shaped like those of certain Ponerinae (Leptogenys, Pachy- 
condyla). 
9. The larva probably spins a cocoon. 
On the other hand C. augustae exhibits unmistakable Doryline characters : - 
I. 
In the conformation of the head and antennae which closely resemble 
those of Eciton. 
a. In the habit of brooding over the eggs. 
The following characters are common to both Dorylinae and Ponerinae : - 
I 
The method of carrying the larvae is common to forms like Eciton and 
Leptogenys, 
a. 
The larva is intermediate between that of Eciton and Stigmatomma. It is 
covered with shorter, less flexuous, and less abundant hairs than the latter and in 
these particulars resembles the larvae of Eciton.1 
These facts go to show that C. aufusfae is a generalized form much like 
the hypothetical ancestor from which both Dorylinae and Ponerinac are supposed 
to have sprung. At the same time, the majority of the characters are Ponerine 
and justify us in adopting the views of Forel who places the tribe Ccrapachyi with 
the Ponerinae. Other species of Cerapachys bear out this interpretation. Dr. 
Hans Brauns writes me from Willowmore, Cape Colony: "Cerapachys ist doch 
wohl sicher eine Poneridc. C.peringuej~i ist bei Port Elizabeth keineswegs selten, 
hier einzeln. Ihr ganzes Betragen ist das eirier Poneride." 
Owing to the close relationship of Cerapachys with both Ponerinae and 
Dorylinae, the recent discovery by Emery of a form (Aneuretus) intermediate 
between the Ponerinac and the Dolichoderinae, and the patent relationship 
between the Ponerinae on the one hand and thc Myrmicinae and Camponotinae on 
the other, it is evident that the Formicidae constitute a very compact group of 
Hymenoptera. This unitary character of the group is still further emphasized by 
its comparatively recent geological origin. Hcnce it should be designated as a 
family, and its five divisions as subfamilies, in accordance with the views of Euro- 
pean myrmecologists like Emery, Ford, Mayr, Wasmann, etc.; and the recent 
tendency of some Cisatlantic 11ymenopte1-ists to regard the ants as a superfamily 
Formicoidea "), consisting of the five families Myrmicidae, Poneridae, etc., is not 
to be commended merely for the sake of making the nomenclature of this group 
look like that of some of the other divisions of the Hymenoptera. 
1 I have not seen Emery's description of the larva of the Ponerim Ectatorama, but I have been able to examine the 
larvae of E. (Halcoponera) sfn'gatum Norton from Guadalajara. Mexico. Thcse larvae are noiituberculate like those of 
SiignzdomwafS!22>m (Bid bull., ~po, vol. 2, p, &i, fig. 8) but covered with long, muhifurcate, somewhat flexuous hairs. 
An exhaustive monographic study of ant-larvae would ceitiiinly iepay the investigator, as they present a bewildering 
array of interesting characters in the various tubercles, " poils d'accrochage, " ctc., with which they are provided.

210 PSYCHE [Oct.- Dec. 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE OALL-WASPS AND THE PARASITIC 
CYNIPOIDS. OR THE SUPERFAMILY CYNIPOIDEA. IV; 
BY WILLIAM H. ASHMEAD, A. -\I., KC. D.. ASSISTANT CURATOR. L-. St NATIONAL 
MUSEUM. 
The members of this tribe form galls only on the Roseworts {JR.osac.eae}, and 
apparently, so far as the records go, will attack no other order of plants, the rose 
(Rosa) and the bramble (RZL~ILS) especially being subject to their attacks ; they show 
some affinity with the AuZacini, some of which also form galls on the Rosace~ but 
these latter are easily distinguished by the venation of the front wings and by abdo- 
minal differences, the hypopygi~~m not being prominent or acutely pointed as in 
the former, while the second segment is usually n~uch shorter. 
Walsh, deceived by the statement of a farmer, described his genus Tribalia 
as forming galls on the potato Solanurn tuberusurn, but these torn out to be root- 
galls on rose, closely resembling a potato. The genus is very closely allied to 
Rhodztes Hartig and has been rechristened recently by Abbe Kieffer under the 
name of Lytoy-hodites. 
I. Front wings with the marginal cell open along the front margin . a 2 
Front wings with the marginal cell completely closed . 3 
2. Mesonot~im usually siibopxcp, finely punctured or coriaceous, with distinct 
parapsidal furrows, the middle lobe usually with a median impressed line 
posteriorly ; sc~~tellum rugulose, without distinct foveae at base ; antennae 
14-jointed in both sexes, the third joint in the 2 not longer than the 4th and 
5th united , Tribalia Walsh 
= Lytorhodites Kieffer 
(Type T. batatorurn Walsh.) 
3. 
Antennae 14-joinled in both sexes, the third joint very long, subclavate, in f 
longer than the 4th and 5th united . . Rhodites Hartig 
(Type Cynips rosae Lime.) 
This tribe is probably the smallest known or at least not many species have as 
yet been discovered, and these confine their attacks to the Mapleworts (Sapindaccan). 




================================================================================


No species is yet known from America, but a more careful search for galls on our 
numerous species of maples will probably show that we have representatives. 
The European species form galls un the leaves of her pseudoplatanus I.. and 
fall into a single genus, which may be recognized by the following characters : - 
Marginal cell open along the front margin, the first abscissa of the radius 
angulated or su-b-ang~ilatecl, the areolet distinct; thorax smooth, shining, with 
distinct, complete parapsidal furrows ; scutellum somewhat elevated on the 
disk and higher than the mesonutnin, the elevated disk is flat or has a slight 
median depression, either smooth or punctate; antennae in agarnous 
$ 11;- 
or 16-jointed, in sexual form 14-jointed in ? and 15-jointed in if, the third 
joint scarcely as long as the scape and pedicel united, but longer than the 
fourth . . Pediaspis ~ischbcin 
= Bathyaspis Forster 
(Type P. sohi Tiscl~h.) 
At present this tribe is not well represented in genera and species, but prob- 
ably will be found to be fully as large as the tribe Cynip/f< since its known mem- 
bers attack several orders of plants and it ncccssarily follows that tlierc n~nst be 
many genera and species still discoverable. 
The known species form galls on he Koseworts (Rosaceae), the Poppyworts 
(Papaveracem), the Crucifers (Cruciferacm"), the Mallows (Malvaceae), the Su- 
macs (Aizacam'ia~~e), the Asterworts (Cumfo.r7tmrae), the Heathworts (Erzkzceae), 
and the Figworts (So-ophztla-f'iaceae). 
Sixteen genera are already known which may be recognized by the use of the 
following table : - 
I. Marginal cell closed along the front margin . 2

Thc members of this tribe attack plants belonging to the order Zegziminoseae. 
Not many species are known and these fall into a single genus, Eschatacertts Mayr, 
described from South America. I have, however, an unclescribed species from 
California and 1 suspect when our sensitive plants, milk-vetches and our many other 
leguminous plants are carefully examined tor galls, many other genera ancl species 
will be discovered. 
The tribe is easily separated from the others by the antennae being inserted 
high up on the face above an imaginary line drawn from the apex of the eyes, ancl 
by peculiarities ot venation. The single genus may be characterized as follows : - 
Front wings with a callosity at the union of (.he l~asal nervure with the median 
vein and another along the first abscissa of the radius, the areolet being 
obliterated and the cubilus originating from this callosity ; hypopygium

Subfamily 111.- Ibaliinae. 
This group is quite distinct from all others in the venation of the front wings, 
in having the abdomen long and very strongly compressed, cultriform or knife 
shaped, and in the totally different shape of the legs, the hind tibiae being very 
long, longitudinally furrowed, with two apical spurs, while the basal joint of the

hind tarsi is somewhat thickened and abnorma,lly lengthened, being nearly twice as 
long as joints 2-5 united. It shows some affinity with the figitidae, and particu- 
larly with the subfamily Liopterinae, and may yet be classified with that family, its 
members being genuine parasites, but with quite different hosts from those of the 
Figitides. In Europe, Mr. Andre has bred Jlialia lezicospoides Hochenwarth from a 
Horn-tail, Sirex s'ts.as L., while in America, Mr. W. Hague Harrington has ascer- 
tained that Ibalia maczdifennis destroys the larvae of Tremexcolumba L. and X$hy 
d'ria albico~nis Harris. In the Riley Collection is a single specimen of Ibalia 
maculipennis labeled, "So. 111. bred from Hickorywoocl, June 4th, 1875,"so that 
probably the group attacks any member of the supci-family Siricoidea, and is there- 
fore of great economic importance. 
The single genus known may be recognized by the following characters : - 
Thorax coarsely, transversely rngulose; J'ront wings with the marginal cell 
long, narrow lanceolate and usually closed ; antennae in $ 13-jointed, filiform,

SOME APHIDS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTS. 
BY WILMATTE PORTER COCKERELL, COI.ORAD0 SPRINGS, COL. 
The species of Lasius which occur here attend both aphids and mealy bugs in 
large numbers and great variety. During the past two years my husband and I 
have made somewhat extended observations on the behavior of the ants toward 
their captives and upon the distribution both of the ants and their prisoners. We 
are indebted to Dr. Wm. M. Wheeler for the identification of the ants. 
The species of ants studied make their nests under flat stones. 
In this climate 
the ants are active during the most of the winter, and live in the corridors under 
the stones, except in very severe weather, when they retire into their subterranean 
chambers carrying their aphids and coccids with them. In the long droughts to 
which this region is subject the ants are obliged in most places, to live far under- 
ground, and after such a siege the number of aphids and coccids is small. In the 
summer, which is the rainy season, the ants' nests are often greatly extended and 
large chambers are made about the roots of plants.

large numbers and great variety. During the past two years my husband and I 
have made somewhat extended observations on the behavior of the ants toward 
their captives and upon the distribution both of the ants and their prisoners. We 
.are indebted to Dr. Wm. M. Wheeler for the identification of the ants. 
The species of ants studied make their nests under flat stones. 
In this climate 
the ants are active during the most of the winter, and live in the corridors under 
the stones, except in very severe weather, when they retire into their subterranean 
chambers carrying their aphids and coccids with them. In the long droughts to 
which this region is subject the ants are obliged in most places, to live far under- 
ground, and after such a siege the number of aphids and coccids is small. In the 
summer, which is the rainy season, the ants' nests are often greatly extended and 
large chambers are made about the roots of plants.

The interesting fact of the occurrence of a brood of Cicada septsmferim within 
the limits of Rhocle Island was, early in June of the present year, contributed to 
the Providence Journal by Mr. James M. Southwick, the curator of the Museum of 
natural history of Roger Williams Park, Providence. Specimens and information 




================================================================================


regarding their appearance were afforded him by Mr. Charles E. Ford, of Providence, 
who afterwards called on me, and kindly gave the following account. In driving, 
June 2, in the town of Coventry, at a point about two miles southwest of \Vashing- 
ton village, near the souLhwest end of Tiogue Reservoir, not far from the New 
London Turnpike, lie was attracted by a loud shrill noise like tlic concert of the 
"purring toad." He saw the scrub oak and other bushes for a distance of about 
one eighth of a mile "covered 
wit11 them"; a great many nymph skins were 
observed clinging to llie bushes, and the ground was full of the holes from which 
the nymplis had crawled out. Mr. Ford also told me that his grandfather observed 
the same insects at the same locality thirty-four years previously, and that lie 
carried two or three of Ilieui to his house and showed them to his family, his mother 
remembering the circumstance. 
Hoping to verify this inroniiation, I went to Washington, but owing to continuous 
stormy weather lasting over two weeks, I was unable to reach the locality until 
June 27. It was easily found, the holes and nymph-skins occurring over an area 
extending about an eighth of a mile on the south side of the road from Washington 
near "The Pat," now a rope manufactory, to the New London turnpike, on rather 
high land, formerly covered with oaks, chestnuts, and a few pines, but now over- 
grown with scrub oaks and chestnuts. 
The nymph skins were abundant, and the scattered holes were numerous, 
sometimes as many as from 4 to 8 to a square foot. It was too late to find any 
living Cicadas, as they may have died somewl~at prematurely from the cffccts of 
the prolonged cold stormy weather. 
The dis~ne~nlxred bodies of the dead Cicaclae, wings, separate abdomens, and 
legs, were picked up. As they were seen alive June 18- 19, the fact that those 1 
saw had been broken up and partly destroyed, perhaps by the little black ants 
frequenting tlie spot, shows how rapidly insect-remaii'is disappear after death, and 
accounts for the fad tlirit so Few enlire dead insects are to be found on the suiface 
of the soil. 
They had laid but a few eggs; only one or two oak twigs contained a 
full complement of cgys, whose presence was indicated by the withered leaves, the 
twig having been perforated, broken, and bent clown. 
Mr. L. F. Berinet~, living' near by, told me that he saw them alive in the tiees 
on June 6 of the present year, and that seventeen years ago a lady saw them in 
this same locdily, /. f., near "The Pat," then caller1 Barclay's. 
Mr. A. J. Aiidrews, the proprietor of the rope manufactory at "The Pat." was 
familiar with the Cicada, telling me tliat his father heard and saw them "about I 7 
years ago'' nt Spring Lake. or "Maple root," a locality in eastern Coventry two 
miles northwest of "The Pat." near Mishnock River, a small stream flowing into 
the Pawtuxet a little west of the village of Washington. He said he heard them

singing, and put several of them in a tin box, carrying them home. 
A third 
locality, reported to me by Mr. Andrews, is in East Greenwich, near the West 
Greenwich line at "Shippies," about half a mile east of Carr Pond. They were 
seen here June 18-19, 1903. 
I may add that Mrs. Emma Wiggins of Anthony, R. I., kindly wrote me that 
Mr. Carpenter of Washington, K. I., saw the 17-year Cicada in the "Pat" region 
about the middle of June this year. EIc told her that it also appeared there seven- 
teen years ago ; that he has one in his house that was collected in the same place 
thirty-four years ago. 
The specimens I collected agreed in size, markings, and color with others from 
the middle states in my collection, presenting no local variations. 
It thus appears that there have been three visitations of the 17-year Cicada in 
Rhode Island, i. e. in 1869, 1886, and certainly in 1903. and that it appears in iso- 
lated places, not con~inuously over an extensive area. 
It may be of interest to recall that Harris, in his Treatise on the injurious 
insects of Massachusetts, slates that this insect is known to have appeared at 
Plymouth, Mass., in 1633, at Plymouth, Sandwich, and Fahnouth, Mass., in 1804, 
at Sandwich in 1787, 1804, and 1821. 
Also in the Connecticut Valley at Hadley 
1818, Westfield, 1835, North Haven, Conn., 1724, 1741, 1758, 1792, dog, 1826, 
1843, and at Martha's Vineyard in 1833. From these dates it would seen1 that there 
is a discrepancy between the Rhode Island years and those of Eastern Massachusetts 
and Martha's Vineyard, the estimated Rhocle Island year, being for the past century 
1808, 1825, 7842, 1869, 1886, and 1903. 
Desirous of ascertaining whether this Cicada had appeared in Massachusetts 
this year, I wrote to Prof. H. T. Fernalc!, Associate entomologist of the ~atch 
experiment station, Amherst, Mass., who writes me as follows : - 
"1 made a quite thorough investigation of this insect this year as we expected 
it here. I obtained the aid of the Secretary of our State Board of Agi-iculturc and 
through him inquired as to its presence, of all of his correspondents in the state, 
besides many of my own In this way I reached every county and quite a number 
of towns in each county, there being over 200 persons in all. 
Not one of them either 
saw or heard of the Cicada this year, and I am satisfied that it was not present in 
the Connecticut valley part of Massachusetts at least, from my observations, and as 
no one reported it from anywhere else I think that if it was present it must have 
been very local."

NOTES ON ACANTHOTHRIPS, 
BY H. J. FRANKTAW, B. S., AMHERST, MASS. 
On the 9th of September, 1903, five females and one male Acmihothrips 
qnafemordi~ Hinds, were found under the loose bark of a sycamore tree near 
the college grounds. Since then, a large number of specimens have been found on 
the same tree. While I have not found them on other sycamores in the neighbor- 
hood, their numbers on this tree would seem to indicate that the sycamore is their 
food plant. It is possible, however, that they fed, during the summer, on plants 
near this tree and that they were simply preparing to hibernate under its bark. 
Acanthothrips magnufemora//i was originally reported from Miami, Florida. 
Dr. Hinds gave a very good description of the male of this species from a single 
specimen and, since 
that time, no further account of the insect seems to have 
appeared and no description of the female has been published. 
Female.- The female, although generalb larger, more robust, and with a more swollen 
abdomen, closely resembles the male in most respects. 
Length 2.28 mm. (2.1 to 2.7 nim.); width of mesothorax 0.49 mm. (0.47 to 0.52 inin.). 
Relative lengths of the segments of the antennae as follows : 
Number of segment, I 2 3 ;I 5 6 7 8 
- - -- - - -- - .- -- 
Spaces of micrometer, 12,3 18.4 37 34 29.6 18.4 18.2 10.5 
Described from nine specimens. 
Two cotypes (two slides) have been deposited in the United States national 
museum. 
Three cotypes (two slides) have been deposited at the Massachusetts 
agricultural college. I have retained four cotypes (one slide). 
The color of the male and female both is mole or less tinged with red, as 
seen by transmitted lighi, croing to the presence of scattered hypodermal pigmenta- 
tion. Fore femora strongly compressed ; two apical segments of the antennae of 
bolh sexes with a straight, longitudinal row of about ten setae seen on the outer 
side of the segments above, when the antennae are antciiorly directed, beginning at 
the apex of the last segment; surface of the abdominal segments reticulated. 
The description of this insect by reflected light is, in many respects, quite dif- 
ferent from that by transmitted light. 
By reflected light, the general color of the body above is seen to be light gray- 
ish tinged with red; the eyes and ocelli are brick-red in color; the last two segments 
of the abdomen before the tube are pale yellow and the outer two thirds of the tube 
is black. There is a dark brown, longitudinal, median basal stripe on the head 
above and the fore femora usually bear one or two isolated brown dots. 
A broad,

Y-shaped, dark brown stripe begins on the mesothorax, crosses the nietathorax, 
and extends on the dorsum of the abdomen to the posterior margin of the seventh 
segment. The base of the stripe is median on the dorsurn of the abdomen and 
grows gradually wider anteiiorly ; it is narrowed between the segments. The 
arms of the Y nearly reach the anterior angles of -the mesothorax. On the thorax, 
the stripe is somewhat lighter in color having a distinct reddish tinge. The pos- 
terior angles of all the abdominal scgrnents above, except the last three, are dis- 
tinctly flecked with pure white. There is also a somewhat indefinite white spot on 
each side of the dorsal stripe on each side segment. 
The appearance of the ven- 
tral side of the imsect is the same by reflected as by transmitted light. 
Lawn.- On the 23d of October, 1303, several specimens, apparently all 
bhiiging to the same larval instar, were found congregated together with a num- 
lwr of adults. 
Length 1.2 nini.; "iidth of meso-thorax -56 mil}. General shape fu6ifonn; color red. 
llead quadrate and lighter in color thim hod? ; cheeks straight and p:irallel ; post-ocular 
bristles prominent and knobbed. The head also bears four other bristles which are similar 
to those behind the eyes; two of these are situated between the eves, one on eacli side, about 
half-wily between the middle of the head :iml he margin of the eye ; the other two rtt-e situ- 
iiteci about half-way between these and the margin of the thorax. The eves are small, round, 
black in color, and very widely separated. Antenuac consisting of seven segments, light- 
brown in color, the third segment the 1011gccyt; second segment bearing knobbed hairs, fourth 
iind fifth segments bearing ;seii.se cones: apical segment bluntly pointed and beiirii'ig a long, 
slender, acute hair at its end. 
Thorax red, with it'regiiliii" and indefinite transpasent markings; bearing knobbed hairs 
like those on the head on nil thi-i.'e cyc'gmenLs. 1.e~ very light brown in color; femora bear- 
ins knobbed hairs ; ti~rsi hearing- two *ti-ong clau-s. 
Abdomen about one-half the length of the hodv, tapering grad~ially to the end of the 
tube; red in colov, with irregular transparent mm-kings ; lii-st segment transparent, fourth 
segment somewhat lighter thm ihe others. All Ihc segments, except the last two, bear 
knobbed hairs. Toward the posterior part of the abdomen, the hairs gmdi.iiilly grow longer. 
Around the posterior inargir oi the yi11 segment there is a circlet of long spines which are 
strongly bent near their tips. The tube is about two thirds the length of the head, tapers 
gradually from bzse to apex. is li,qht brown in color; and bears a circlet of acutely pointed 
spines at its tip: oii1~- two of the eight exlremely long hairs xen in the adult are dei-eloped- 
and these are on Llie vcntral side ot the tube in all iny specimens. 
On October 31x1, loo-;, I found a liirgc female Aca1zthothrips viodzrornis Reut. 
also under the buk of the sycamore. 
'I'liis is the species on which Uzel founded 
the genus and it docs not seem to have been ~eporLecl lieietofore in this country. 
It would be useless for one to attempt to redescribe the species from one 
specimen, but this species may be readily distinguished from magnar/no/-ali-s by 
its larger size and dark brown color. The last three abdominal segments are dark 




================================================================================


brown and the tube does not bear a circlet of eight very long hairs as in magna- 
femoral2.r. There is a very distinct white fleck, seen by reflected light, on the ante- 
rior corners of all the abdominal segments above, except the two basal and the 
two apical. 
Uzel gives the average length of the females of the species as being 
2.4 nun. My specimen is a very large one measuring about 3 mm. in length. 
The foregoing studies were made at the Entomological laboratory of the Massa- 
chusetts agricultural college.

A TECHNIQUE FOR EFFICIENT SORTING OF 
LIVE TERMITES FROM DEBRIS 
BY BARBARA L. THORNE AND NANCY L. BREISCH 
Department of Entomology 
University of Maryland 
College Park, MD 20742-5575 
Sorting live termites from nest debris or soil is normally a labor- 
intensive procedure. Heavily populated nest sections or pieces of 
infested wood can be tapped over a collection dish, yielding satis- 
fying results at first but often diminishing rewards as termites hold 
on tenaciously or retreat to central cavities. Further, the process of 
tapping invariably also produces small pieces of debris as contami- 
nants in the collection tray. Those particles are unacceptable for 
clean samples for such purposes as reference collections, chemical 
or DNA analyses, weights, or volumetric samples. In these circum- 
stances, a second stage "clean sort" is necessary. 
Among the techniques for picking out termites one by one, 
featherweight forceps are effective if administered gently. Some 
people prefer to use aspirators, but these should be limited to 
reverse-flow aspirators because of the hazard of lung infection 
from inhaling soil microbes or fungal spores present amidst termite 
debris. The receiving vial of an aspirator must be emptied fre- 
quently to avoid insect damage due to crowding. Soldier termites 
with defense secretions may obstruct aspirator suction tubes. 
Termitologists with sufficient patience use small paintbrushes to 
separate termites, nudging them towards a target receptacle or

waiting for them to crawl onto the brush, then collecting them with 
a quick flick into a container. Narrow cardboard strips (or folded 
index cards) are used in the same manner. 
Termite biologists use a variety of techniques to separate larger 
numbers of termites from broken nest fragments, splintered wood 
or soil. "Papering off' or "carding" termites works well for many 
species (Gay et al. 1955, McMahan and Watson 1977). In this 
approach one places a piece of paper or an index card on an active 
section of debris, letting the termites crawl onto the paper. Many 
species respond well to vertical positioning of the paper surface. 
When the card accumulates a large number of exploring termites, it 
is moved over to a collecting dish and tapped or flicked to dislodge 
the insects. The procedure is repeated as desired for collecting or 
sampling. Corrugated cardboard or moist paper towels are standard 
substrate variants for this technique, depending on conditions and 
the species under study. 
Sieves with moisture below (eg. a container of moist sand or fil- 
ter paper) and/or heat above (light bulb) can work well to encour- 
age termites to sort themselves from other substrates by crawling 
through the sieve screen and dropping to the container below. Cau- 
tion must be taken, however, to check the apparatus frequently to 
avoid dessication. 
In studies in which entire nests have been fumigated, water 
flotation methods are used to separate dead termites from nest and 
particle debris (Wiegert 1970, Darlington 1984). 
Isolating large numbers of subterranean termites from wood and 
soil debris is particularly challenging. These insects are typically 
small and delicate, and mortality from handling can be substantial 
with standard methods of obtaining clean samples. We describe 
here a quick, effective and inexpensive technique for sorting live 
Reticulitermes from debris. We have tested the technique with R. 
flavipes (Kollar), R. virginicus (Banks) and R. hesperus Banks. 
This approach may well be generalized or adapted for use with 
other termite genera. 
Remove termites from their host substrate by tapping occupied 
sections over a collection tray or flat container. Splinters of wood 
debris, termite galleries and soil will also rain into the collection

arena. Large fragments of wood should be removed to reduce 
harborage for the termites. After this initial crude separation, lay 
lengths of flexible plastic tubing (3116" internal diameter; 114" out- 
side diameter) in the collection tray, positioned such that the open 
ends are accessible to termites and the tube lies relatively flat. Ter- 
mites frequently travel along the perimeter of containers, so pru- 
dent placement of tube ends intersects these routes (especially 
corners). Open ends are best cut at angles rather than straight to 
expose more surface area at the opening. Tube length is not impor- 
tant, but 10-20 cm sections are convenient. 
Termites will soon begin to crawl into the tubes, packing in 
tightly with immigration greatly exceeding emigration. Termites 
prefer tight spaces over open areas, and are thus cooperative in 
remaining in the tubes. Leave the termites to self-sort; depending 
on numbers and activity level an interval of 10-60 minutes should 
yield good results. 
When a tube is filled or sufficiently occupied, carefully lift it 
over a second collecting vessel and gently tap out the termites. 
Alternatively, a longer length of collection tubing (eg. 1 meter) can 
be draped over the edge of a lab bench, with one or both ends posi- 
tioned in a new collection receptacle. Termites crawl out of the 
tubing into the container, eliminating the need for handling or dis- 
turbance. Replace the tubing for additional sampling. "Condi- 
tioned" tubes (previously occupied by termites, or formerly used as 
transit connections between two containers of termites) will out- 
perform clean tubing, but ultimately even new tubes will entice ter- 
mites. 
The tube technique can be used in conjunction with other meth- 
ods; for example lengths of tubing placed in the collection recepta- 
cle under a sieve or Berlese sorting apparatus will attract dislodged 
termites and thus reduce dessication stress. 
The tube technique has a number of advantages over many other 
methods to collect Reticulitermes. After a quick, crude initial sepa- 
ration the biologist need return only occasionally to retrieve groups 
of uninjured, protected, debris-free specimens.

A REVISION OF THE GENUS DZEROPSXS GAHAN 
(COLEOPTERA: CLERIDAE: CLERINAE) 
Department of Entomology 
Museum of Comparative Zoology 
Harvard University 
Cambridge, MA 021 38 
The genus Dieropsis Gahan is certainly one of the most unusual 
genera of the family Cleridae. Its position within the Cleridae has 
been discussed by Gahan (1908:95-96), Schenkling (1910:98). 
Corporaal (1950:244), Crowson (1964:303), and Winkler (1964: 
3 17-329; l982:5 19-523). Species of the genus Dieropsis display 
unique characters such as the elongated profemora and protibiae in 
males of one species and an unusual ocular division which Winkler 
(1964:317-329; 1982519-523) has argued call for the establish- 
ment of a separate subfamily (Dieropsinae) for this genus. On the 
other hand, Gahan (19089-96), Schenkling (1910:98), Corporaal 
(1950:244), and Crowson (1964:303) retain the species of this 
genus within the subfamily Clerinae near the genus Trichodes 
Herbst. I have been able, through a Hennigian analysis similar to 
that performed by Ekis (1977:126-134), to show that the sister 
group of the genus Dieropsis is the genus Trichodes and therefore 
recognition of a subfamily Dieropsinae would invalidate the previ- 
ously established subfamily Clerinae by paraphyly. 
The number of species in the genus Dieropsis has also been 
open to debate. Gahan (1908:95-96) described a single sexually 
dimorphic species, Dieropsis quadriplagiata Gahan, while Winkler 
(1964:305-329) described the female representatives of Gahan's 
Dieropsis quadriplagiata as a separate species, Dieropsis femina 
Winkler. On the basis of my own morphological investigations, I 
have been able to determine that the majority of specimens identi- 
fied as Dieropsis femina are actually females of the species 
Dieropsis quadriplagiata, while those specimens identified as

Dieropsis femina which are male do not differ in the structure of 
their genitalia from other males of the species Dieropsis quadripla- 
giata. I have therefore synonymized Dieropsis femina with Dierop- 
sis quadriplagiata. However, I have found that a second, 
undescribed species of the genus Dieropsis exists which differs in 
the structure of its male genitalia from Dieropsis quadriplagiata. 
This species is described as Dieropsis ralphi New Species below.

Discussion of New Synonymy 
In the collection of the Institut Royal de Sciences 
Naturelles de Belgique I discovered a pair of Dieropsis 
quadriplagiata taken in copula by F. G. Overlaet at 
Kafakumba, Katanga, Belgian Congo (see Figures 1 and 2). 
The female is indistinguishable from the "male" holotype of 
Dieropsis femina as described and illustrated by Winkler 
(1 964:3 15-3 18). I thus have no difficulty in synonymizing 
Dieropsis femina with Dieropsis quadriplagiata on the basis 
of this evidence. 
Further evidence for my conclusion is provided by Win- 
kler himself, when he claims that Dieropsis quadriplagiata 
(sensu Winkler) is "ninety-nine percent male" while Dierop- 
sis femina is "ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent female" 
(Winkler 1982:523). In no other species in the family Cleri- 
dae are such disproportionate sex ratios known. While a 
species which was entirely female could reproduce through 
parthenogenesis, a species which was entirely male would 
certainly become extinct. It is also extremely unlikely that 
two species of Cleridae as large as the species of the genus 
Dieropsis could co-exist in such close ecological association 
as is indicated by the collection data presented by myself 
below and by Winkler (1964:312, 315), where individuals of 
Dieropsis quadriplagiata (sensu Winkler) and Dieropsis fem-

ina were consistently collected at the same time in the same 
locality by the same collector. Furthermore, the characters 
given by Winkler for separating his two "species" (such as 
the enlargement of the femora and tibiae and the emarginate 
versus rounded fifth visible abdominal sternite) are well- 
known characters of sexual dimorphism in the family Cleri- 
dae. 
With regards to the male genitalia dissected by Winkler 
from a "short-legged" specimen of the genus Dieropsis (see 
Winkler 1964:306-307), I must note that I have examined a 
number of male specimens of this species which possessed 
slightly (and sometimes significantly) shorter profemora and 
protibiae but which did not differ in any other characters 
(including genitalic structure) from males with more elongate 
profemora and protibiae. These males could be readily distin- 
guished from males of Dieropsis ralphi New Species by the 
differences in the structure of the apex of the tegmen. I have 
provided a line drawing of a particularly unusual male from 
Kafakumba in the Belgian Congo (ex MRAC; see Figure 4) 
in which the left protibia measures 7.4 mm in length while 
the right protibia measures 10.3 mm in length. This specimen 
clearly illustrates the unreliability of male protibial length for 
species diagnoses in the genus Dieropsis.

Biology of Species of the Genus Dieropsis Gahan 
Little is known, aside from speculation by Winkler (1964: 
318-3241, of the habits of either adults or larvae of the species of 
the genus Dieropsis. The only biological information accompany- 
ing any of the specimens I examined was associated with the holo- 
type of Dieropsis ralphi, which had been collected from a 
hollyhock flower. It is not surprising that species of the genus 
Dieropsis frequent flowers, because their closest living relatives 
(species of the genus Trichodes) are well-known flower visitors. 
Numerous species of the genus Trichodes are also mimics of 
flower-visiting beetles of the family Meloidae. Species of the

genus Dieropsis are similar in size and coloration to poisonous 
meloid beetles of the genus Mylabris Fabricius, found abundantly 
at the same time and in the same geographical regions. Dieropsis 
ralphi bears a remarkable resemblance to these meloids, particu- 
larly to the common species Mylabris dicincta Bertoloni. Females 
of Dieropsis quadriplagiata are more similar in appearance to

these meloids than are males of Dieropsis quadriplagiata. The 
decreased similarity in the males is due to their elongated pro- 
femora and protibiae, characters which may reduce the survival 
rate of males but which presumably have some importance in sex- 
ual selection. 
The latter hypothesis is supported by the similarity of the ante- 
rior legs of male Dieropsis quadriplugiatu to the anterior legs of 
male Golofa porteri (Hope) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), which are 
employed in ritualized combat (see Eberhard 1980: 166-1 68). The 
prothorax of species of the genus Dieropsis is less dorsoventrally 
compressed than in related genera, indicating an enlargement of 
those muscles which would be used in manipulating the front legs 
during such combat. Alternatively, the elongated male profemora 
and protibiae may be used to grasp the female during copulation. 
The Status of the Subfamily Dieropsinae 
Winkler (19641317-329) erected the subfamily Dieropsinae for 
the reception of the species in Dieropsis on the basis of a number 
of unusual characters. In order to ascertain the validity of this 
action under the current phylogenetic system three questions must 
be answered: first, would a proposed subfamily Dieropsinae be 
monophyletic; second, is the sister-taxon of Dieropsis the entire 
subfamily Clerinae or some smaller group within the Clerinae; and 
third (which follows logically from the second), would recognition 
of the subfamily Dieropsinae invalidate any previously existing 
subfamily-level taxa such as the Clerinae by paraphyly? 
I have listed in Tables I and 11 the various character states which 
were given by Winkler (1 96413 17-329) in defining the Dieropsinae 
as well as the corresponding character states of the genus Tri- 
chodes, conventionally assumed to be the sister-taxon of Dieropsis. 
For outgroup comparison I have used the genus Opilo, which has 
been conventionally assumed to be the sister-taxon of Trichodes 
(Foster 197617). The format for Tables I and I1 has been adapted 
from that used by Carpenter (1987: 415-421). 
A number of autapomorphous characters in Dieropsis which are 
highly convergent in the family Cleridae deserve further comment, 
since Winkler claims several of these characters are of great impor- 
tance in establishing the subfamily Dieropsinae. The first of these 
is the general pronotal structure, which in Dieropsis is similar to

my opinion, is probably closely related to Trichodes). The second 
convergent character is the pronotal tubercles, which have indepen-

tion of the tarsal pulvilli and first tarsal segment has occurred in a 
number of genera, including Calendyma, Metaxina, and Odon- 
tophlogistus. The final convergent character is that of the elytral 
apices being devoid of punctures. This character has independently 
evolved in a number of Australian genera, including Trogodendron,

Phlogistus, Scrobiger, Neoscrobiger, Tarsostenodes, and Black- 
burniella, as well as in the Madagascan genus Myrmecomaea. As I 
stated above, I do not think it wise to base a subfamily-level taxon 
in the family Cleridae on any of these characters since such a 
group would almost certainly not be monophyletic (as was the case 
with Winkler's subfamily Cleropiestinae; see Menier 198 1 : 141). 
The first question posed at the beginning of this section is not 
difficult to answer. From the data presented in Tables I and I1 it can 
clearly be seen that the species of Dieropsis share at least six 
autapomorphous character states (1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 11) and are 
therefore more closely related to each other than to any third 
species. Hence, Dieropsis is monophyletic and any taxon which 
contained solely the genus Dieropsis would also be monophyletic. 
However, the species of Dieropsis also share at least ten derived 
character states with the species of Trichodes. Based on outgroup 
comparison with Opilo, character states 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 
17, and 18 are synapomorphous between Trichodes and Dieropsis. 
It should be readily apparent from even cursory inspection of Table

I1 that the sister group of Dieropsis is, as was first predicted by 
Gahan (1908:96), Trichodes and not the entire subfamily Clerinae 
(as would be required for recognition of the Dieropsinae under the 
current phylogenetic system). From the large number of shared 
derived character states it seems likely to me that isolation and 
evolution of Dieropsis have occurred relatively recently. 
Having determined that the sister group of Dieropsis is Tri- 
chodes, we can now turn to the third question. In my opinion, strict 
monophyly is critical to a defensible philosophy of classification, 
particularly in groups such as the Cleridae which have been con- 
ventionally regarded as "difficult" groups to study due to the fre- 
quency of morphological convergences. Since Trichodes is also 
related to a group of genera in the subfamily Clerinae including the 
North American genus Aulicus and the Old World genus Opilo 
(Foster 1976:7), any classification scheme which recognized a sub- 
family Dieropsinae would also create a paraphyletic subfamily 
Clerinae. Therefore, in accordance with strict monophyly, the sub- 
family Dieropsinae must be synonymized with the previously 
established subfamily Clerinae.

The genus Dieropsis Gahan (Coleoptera: Cleridae: Clerinae) is 
revised, with two species (Dieropsis quadriplagiata Gahan and 
Dieropsis ralphi NEW SPECIES) recognized. Dieropsis fernina 
Winkler is placed as a synonym of Dieropsis quadriplagiata 
Gahan, NEW SYNONYMY. Mimicry of species of Meloidae by 
species of the genus Dieropsis is discussed. Monophyly of the 
genus Dieropsis is confirmed. The sister taxon of the genus 
Dieropsis is shown to be the genus Trichodes Herbst, and therefore 
the subfamily Dieropsinae is placed in synonymy with the previ- 
ously established subfamily Clerinae to prevent invalidation of the 
Clerinae by paraphyly.

OBSERVATIONS ON AGGREGATIONS OF MALES OF TWO 
SPECIES OF BEEWOLVES 
(HYMENOPTERA: SPHECIDAE: PHILANTHUS) 
Department of Entomology

It is well known that populations of beewolves (Philanthus) may 
persist in suitable places for many years so long as there is no seri- 
ous disturbance to the habitat (Evans and O'Neill 1988). Within 
these sites nest density may vary considerably, and the distribution 
of defended, scent-marked territories is closely dependent upon 
nest density. When nests are highly clumped, males establish terri- 
tories apart from but adjacent to the nests, often in flyways used by 
the females (e.g. in I? pulcher). When nests are moderately spaced, 
males may establish territories among the nests (e.g. in P. 
bicinctus). When nests are widely dispersed, males aggregate to 
form leks, perhaps resulting in a more massive chemical signal that 
attracts females from a distance (e.g. in l? basilaris). Intraspecific 
variation in nest density and corresponding distribution of males 
has been reported for several species (Evans and O'Neill 1988). 
This report concerns populations of two species in which the 
nests are widely dispersed and in which males aggregate each year 
at the same site and indeed occupy the same or very similar territo- 
rial spaces year after year. The two species, barbatus and crabroni- 
formis, are members of the gibbosus group and are very similar in 
structure as well as in size and coloration. The two species are 
sympatric throughout much of the West and both occur at moderate 
elevations in montane areas. The present studies were conducted 
about 20 km west of Livermore, Larimer Co., Colorado, at eleva- 
tions of 2130-2260 m. This is an area of rolling hills covered with 
grasses, forbs, bushes, and irregularly distributed ponderosa pines, 
Douglas-firs, and junipers. Patches of bare, friable soil suitable as

nesting sites are sparse, and females of both barbatus and 
crabroniformis have been found nesting only in scattered eroded 
slopes and in banks along gravel roads. P. crabroniformis emerges 
two to three weeks earlier than barbatus, but it is not unusual to 
find both sexes of both species feeding at Solidago blossoms in 
late summer. An aggregation of males of each species has now 
been monitored for 7-8 years. That of crabroniformis is located 
just below a hilltop, that of barbatus at the bottom of a broad gully 
1.8 km away. Thus both are on fairly prominent landmarks, though 
of a very different nature. 
McDaniel et al. (1992) have recently studied the territory- 
marking pheromones of these two species, basing their analyses on 
specimens taken from these same two populations. The 
pheromones were found to be very different, that of barbatus con- 
taining mainly aldehydes and the ester ethyl tetradecanoate, that of 
crabroniformis lacking aldehydes but containing several esters 
other than ethyl tetradecanoate. The pheromones of six species of 
Philanthus have now been analyzed by McDaniel and his associ- 
ates, and all have been found to be quite different. In the present 
instance, the two species overlap only slightly in time and aggre- 
gate at quite different sites, but this may not be the case in other 
localities. 
Philanthus crabroniformis 
An assemblage of males has formed each of seven years 
(1986-1992) on the northeast side of a hill surmounted by a rocky 
outcrop, at an altitude of 2260 m. Males have appeared each year 
about July 1 and remained active for about four weeks. Each occu- 
pied a territory roughly a meter in diameter on the ground beneath 
an open canopy of ponderosa pines, just a short distance below the 
top of the hill and somewhat shielded from the predominantly 
southwest summer winds. Perching occurred mainly on the ground, 
scent-marking on low grasses and forbs, mostly less than 0.5 m 
tall, or less commonly on low leaves of shrubs adjacent to territo- 
ries, chiefly Cercocarpus and Juniperus. Males appeared each 
morning about 10 o'clock (Mountain Daylight Time) and remained 
active until mid-afternoon unless heavy clouds appeared. There 
was much aggression among males soon after they first appeared, 
and much scent-marking soon after they had established territories. 




================================================================================


19931 Evans 
Certain territories were occupied with great consistency. In 1989, 
12 males were collected (for pheromone analysis) from only 4 ter- 
ritories; each was reoccupied within 4 to 43 minutes (x= 12.3 
min). One territory was reoccupied 4 times within 20 minutes as 
successive males were removed. 
The overall area occupied by the aggregation measured 18 by 
35 m. Within that area three territorial spaces were occupied each 
of the seven years (Fig. 1). Others were occupied for several years, 
but not every year, still others during only one year. Those occu- 
pied over several years were also those most often occupied 
throughout the active season. For example, territory 12 (lowest 
solid circle in Fig. l), occupied each of the seven years of study, 
was occupied in 1991 and 1992 on every day on which observa- 
tions were made. At the other extreme, territory 20 (lowest hollow 
circle in Fig. 1) was seen to be occupied for only one day in 1991, 
and was not seen to have been occupied on other dates or other 
years. Other territories were intermediate in terms of yearly and 
daily occupation. 
The area occupied by males was divided into two partially 
sunny parts by a grove of pines providing deep shade. An upper 
group of males occupied territories adjacent to the rocks, a lower 
group a grassy slope with scattered trees and bushes. In the upper 
group, during 199 1, nearest neighbor distance between perches 
varied from 1.5 to 15 m (%= 8.8 m), while in the lower group 
nearest neighbor distance varied from 1.2 to 11 m (x= 6.0 m). 
About 15 m separated the closest territory from each group. The 
mean overall nearest neighbor distance was 9.7 m. 
These figures remained relatively constant from year to year 
during the major part of the active season (early and late in the sea- 
son, when there were few territories, distances were greater). In the 
lower group, nearest neighbor distance averaged 6.5 m in 1988, 6.2 
m in 1990. The number of territorial males varied slightly from 
year to year. In 1988 I marked 16 territories, of which no more 
than 9 were occupied on any one day; in 1990 I marked 18 territo- 
ries, of which no more than 10 were occupied on any one day; in 
1991 I marked 20 territories, of which no more than 11 were occu- 
pied on any one day. In 1992 the population was low; only 7 terri- 
tories were marked, of which no more than 4 were occupied on any 
one day.

Careful search in surrounding areas failed to reveal further 
aggregations of males or any nests of females. The nearest nest 
was found in a sloping bank along a dirt road 2.2 km away. It 
seems likely that nests were scattered about over a wide area, in 
limited sites where there was a friable soil in eroded banks. This 
stands in contrast to a dense nesting aggregation of this species 
reported by Evans and O'Neill (1988) from Teton Co., Wyoming. 
In that case male territories were grouped a short distance upwind 
of the nests. In the present instance, it appeared that females were 
attracted from a wide area to a particular landmark where males 
had established territories and possibly produced enough 
pheromone to attract females from a distance. On no occasion did I 
observe females within the aggregation of males, but evidence 
from this and other species of Philanthus suggests that most mat- 
ing occurs at male territories (Evans and O'Neill, 1988). 
Philanthus barbatus 
The aggregation of P. barbatus males was located 1.8 km SW of 
the crabroniformis site, at an elevation of 2130 m. Males occupied 
territories for each of eight years (1985-1992) at the bottom of a 
broad, generally dry ravine, in places that were sunny during much 
of the day, though shaded by nearby trees during the early morning 
and late afternoon. Males appeared each year in late July and 
remained active into early September. Thus there was limited over- 
lap with crabroniformis in time (about a week), but the two aggre- 
gations were widely separated and located in very different 
topography. 
Males arrived on territories each morning about 10:30 (MDT) 
and remained active until mid-afternoon unless there were heavy 
clouds. Territories were distributed in a somewhat linear pattern 
over an area about 20 m wide by 50 m long (Fig. 2). A gravel road 
and a ditch bisected the area; together these measured about 10 m 
across. Thus, as in the case of crabroniformis, there was a lower 
group of territories (no more than 3) and an upper group (of up to 
12). Both sites were covered with tall grasses, 0.3-0.8 m high. 
Males selected perches among the grasses, usually on or close to 
the ground where there was bare soil or grasses that had been mat- 
ted by the feet of mule deer or humans. Scent-marking occurred on 
the stems or tops of these grasses over a radius of as much as a

meter from the perches. In the morning hours, much aggression 
occurred between males, including swirling flights and some 
butting and grappling. Evans and O'Neill (1988) reported briefly 
on the behavior of males at this site, based on observations made in 
1985. 
During 1988, 13 males were collected from as many territories 
on July 24 for pheromone studies. On the following day 13 more 
were collected, most of them from the same territories as the day 
before. Most of these same territorial spaces were found to be 
reoccupied on August 10. Two of these territorial spaces have been 
reoccupied each of the eight years, and it is these that are occupied 
most consistently throughout the season each year. 
The number of territories varied from 6 to 13 over the period of 
study. During 1991, there were two territories in the lower group, 
the perches 2.5 m apart; in the upper group there were 11 territo- 
ries, no more than 9 occupied on any one day. Nearest neighbor 
distance in the upper group varied from 1.6 to 8.3 m (X= 5.5 m). 
Many hours of searching in the area revealed only one nest of a 
female, this in a bank along a dirt road about 0.3 km away. Other 
nests have been found on eroded banks at a distance of one to sev- 
eral km from the aggregation of males. 
This area, covered as it is with open pine forests and with fields 
of diverse grasses, forbs, and bushes, offered few places where 
there was bare, friable soil suitable for nesting. Thus nests were 
scattered widely in banks along roads and in eroded slopes. 
Despite much effort, only a few nests of either species could be 
found, and these were widely separated from one another. This 
contrasts to other known populations of these same two species. 
Evans and O'Neill (1988) reported a dense aggregation of 16 nests 
of crabroniformis in a sandy track in Teton Co., Wyoming; males 
were grouped 1-8 m apart 40-60 m upwind of the nests. They also 
reported a group of 9 nests of barbatus in Larimer Co., Colorado, 
where there were territorial males only a few meters away. 
The two populations considered here provide further examples 
of the persistence of male aggregations and of intraspecific varia- 
tion in male mating tactics. When only widely dispersed nesting 
sites are available, it is evidently adaptive for males to seek 




================================================================================


32 Psyche [vo~. 100 
communal territorial sites at conspicuous landmarks and for 
females to seek these landmarks either visually or in response to a 
more massive output of pheromone by males. It is curious that 
males of crabroniformis seek a slope adjacent to a rocky hilltop 
while those of the closely related barbatus establish their territo- 
ries at the bottom of a ravine. It is perhaps worthy of note that the 
population of barbatus studied by Evans (1982) also occurred near 
the bottom of a ravine, though in this case territories and nests 
were only a few meters apart. 
It is equally difficult to explain why certain territorial spaces are 
occupied each year. The pheromones applied to vegetation are not 
long persistent, and in any case the grass blades, stems, and leaves 
that are marked are not present year to year. It seems probable that 
males orient visually both to the territorial area and to specific 
points within it. Possibly they respond to cues provided by wind 
speed, overhead incidence of sunlight, and peripheral images of 
trees, shrubs, or rocks. A more or less bare space surrounded by 
vegetation is obviously required, but there were many such spaces 
in both areas that were not or only rarely occupied. 
More or less permanent lekking sites are, of course, well known 
in some birds and mammals, and are especially well studied in 
grouse (Bergerud and Gratson, 1988). In most cases males move to 
traditional sites at mating season and attempt to gain central posi- 
tions in the leks. The most favored territories of the two species of 
Philanthus considered here were not central in position. O'Neill 
(1983) found no evidence that larger (thus more dominant) males 
of P. basilaris occupied central positions in the leks. Evidently ter- 
ritory quality is determined by some factor other than a central 
position. If indeed females are attracted to pheromones from a dis- 
tance, peripheral territories may be more likely to intercept 
females than central ones. Further study may add to our under- 
standing of these matters. 
Populations of two species of beewolves were studied in mon- 
tane areas in Larimer Co., Colorado. Males of each species have 
aggregated each of 7-8 years, either near the top of a hill (Philan- 
thus crabroniformis) or near the bottom of a ravine (P. barbatus). 
In both cases there were certain territorial spaces that have been 




================================================================================


19931 Evans 
occupied each year of study, and these same spaces have also been 
occupied on each day of study throughout the season. Nests are 
widely dispersed, and females appear to be attracted to male aggre- 
gations with respect to landmarks and/or in response to the collec- 
tive pheromones produced by the males. Why these sites are 
occupied each year, and why specific territorial spaces are reoccu- 
pied each year, remain to be explained.

MODES AND FREQUENCIES OF COLONIZATION AND ITS 
RELATION TO EXTINCTIONS, HABITAT AND 
SEASONALITY IN THE SOCIAL SPIDER ANELOSIMUS 
EXIMIUS IN THE AMAZON (ARANEIDAE: THERIDIIDAE)

The theridiid genus Anelosimus consists of 26 described species 
in the Americas. 14 of these are endemic to Chile and the Argen- 
tine Patagonia, while the remaining species are widely distributed 
through Central and South America (Levi, 1956, 1963, 1972). Of 
these, 4 species are known to have highly organized social behav- 
ior, and the best known, A. eximius Keyserling ranges from 
Argentina to Panama (Stejskal, 1976; Vollrath, 1982; Christenson, 
1984). 
Colony populations in A. eximius range from <I00 to >10000 
(Simon, 189 1 ; Brach, 1975; Stejskal, 1976; Vollrath, 1982; Nen- 
twig, 1985; Smith, 1989). Colonies of social species of Anelosimus 
characteristically have adult sex ratios highly skewed in favor of 
females (Fowler & Levi, 1979; Vollrath, 1986a, 1986b; Aviles, 
1986). Two forms of colony foundation have been recorded in 
social Anelosimus: dispersion of solitary gravid females, and group 
migration, or sociotomy (Fowler & Levi, 1979; Vollrath, 1982; 
Christenson, 1984). Predation is intense on solitary dispersing 
gravid females (Vollrath, 1982; Christenson, 1984), and this should 
favor sociotomy (Vollrath, 1982). 
However, all studies of colony foundation were performed with 
colonies in perturbed habitats and little is known of their behavior

and ecology in the forest interior. Pasquet & Krafft (1989) con- 
cluded that it was highly improbable to find colonies in the forest 
interior, although Smith (1986) recorded colony clusters along a 
trail through continuous forest in Suriname. Moreover, the relation 
between colony extinctions and the intensity and types of coloniza- 
tion has not been examined. 
In this paper, we examine populations of A. eximius in both con- 
tinuous Amazonian forest as well as forest edges. Specifically, we 
document modes of colonizations, and their relation to habitat, sea- 
sonality and colony extinction rates. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Studies were conducted in the Biological Dynamics of Forest 
Fragments Reserves of the Smithsonian Institution/World Wildlife 
FundINational Institute for Amazonian Research (Manaus, Amazo- 
nia, Brazil) in both continuous forest (Cabo Frio Reserve) and for- 
est edge (the road to Cidade de Powell) (2' 24'S, 59O 52'W). 
Forests are typical "terra firme" forests (Pires and Prance, 1985), 
with canopy heights ranging from 30 to 37 m, and emergent vege- 
tation reaching 40 to 50 m. 235 woody species have been recorded 
for 1 ha of this forest type (Pires & Prance, 1985). Understory veg- 
etation is characterized by the abundance of dwarf palms (Are- 
caceae) (Kahn & Castro, 1985). Mean annual precipitation, 
averaged over a 30-yr period, for nearby Manaus (80 km) is 2186 
mm. 
Every 30 days from August, 1988, to August, 1989, fixed tran- 
sects were walked in both study areas. All colonies encountered 
were individually numbered and marked with red or yellow band- 
ing tape. In this paper, we include only data on colony foundations 
and extinctions of colonies known to have been founded during our 
studies. Foundation types were divided into two types: solitary 
females, with or without egg sacs present, and sociotomy, in which 
groups consisted of a variable number of spiders of both sexes, 
often with juveniles. 
144 incipient colonies were registered during the 12 months. Of 
these the forest border had 101, while the closed forest had only

43. Nevertheless, mean incipient colony life-span for colonies in 
closed forest (x= 167 days, s2 = 1 1 1.4) was significantly higher 
than that recorded for incipient colonies in the forest border 
(x= 88 days, s2 = 68.9) (t - 5.20, P < 0.01). 
Of the 101 colony foundations registered at the forest border, 20 
were by solitary females, contrasted with only one of the 43 colony 
foundations witnessed for the closed forest (G = 4.808; P < 0.05). 
Corresponding mean recorded life-spans were 119.3 (s2 = 94.22) 
days for colonies founded by sociotomy, and 66.6 (s2 = 52.12) 
days for foundations by solitary females (t = 13.01; P < 0.01). 
Mean life span for colonies founded by sociotomy varied signifi- 
cantly between forest edge and interior (x 90 vs 173, respectively, 
F = 22.26, P < 0.01). As only one colony was founded by solitary 
females in the forest interior, it was impossible to compare life 
spans between settings. 
The annual ratio of foundations to extinctions was 1.32 for the 
forest edge, and 1.86 for the forest interior. No significant differ- 
ences were found between months in colony extinctions (Fig. 1; 
Table 1). However, significant differences in extinctions were

found between forest edge and interior. Colony foundations, how- 
ever, varied significantly with respect to both setting and month 
(Fig. 1; Table 1). Monthly colony foundations were negatively cor- 
related with monthly cumulative rainfall, r = -0.448 (P = 0.028), 
but not colony extinctions, r = 0.1 16 (P = 0.588). 
Our results confirm Vollrath's (1982) and Christenson's (1984) 
observations that colonies founded by solitary females have higher 
mortality rates than those founded by sociotomy. However, we 
were able to separate strategies used in colony foundation based 
upon habitat. Forest borders had statistically higher rates of colony 
foundation by solitary females than did continuous forest (9 times 
as great), but total rates of colonization were more than twice as 
high in the forest edge than in the forest interior, as expected for 
more unstable habitats (Kuno, 1981). However, colonies founded 
in the forest interior had significantly longer life spans than those 
founded on the forest edge, an effect previously not documented. 
No significant monthly differences were found for colony 
extinctions. However, significant monthly differences were found 
for colony foundations. Both colony extinctions and foundations 
varied significantly between forest edge and interior. Contrary to 




================================================================================


19931 Venticinque, Fowler & Silva 39 
our original hypothesis, colony foundations were negatively corre- 
lated with rainfall, unlike colony extinctions. Colony foundations 
occur at times of probable food shortage (dry months), while 
established colonies face a constant probability of extinction, irre- 
spective of climatic conditions or setting. An alternative, but not 
mutually exclusive hypothesis, is that microclimatic fluctuations 
are more severe on the forest edge, inducing colony extinctions. 
This may explain significant differences in foundations and extinc- 
tions related with setting, which should also be driven by microcli- 
mate. In either case, whether food availability or microclimatic 
extremes push these dynamics is irrelevant. Forest edges, judged 
by dispersion criteria, are more unstable (Kuno, 198 1). 
The higher proportion of colony foundations by solitary females 
at forest edges suggests that this strategy may be in response to 
maintenance of genetic viability (Smith, 1986). This may also be 
in response to a higher overall web-spider abundance at forest 
edges (Vieira, 1990), which would limit available space for 
sociotomy, but not for solitary females. As sufficient data were 
lacking on the survivorship of colonies founded by solitary females 
in the forest interior, a comparison of colony survivorship could 
not be made. However, the greater frequency of sociotomy in the 
forest interior may indicate a more homogeneous environment, 
coupled with higher rates of inbreeding. 
Numbers of colonizations and extinctions of incipient colonies 
of the social spider Anelosimus eximius were greater at the edges 
of Amazonian forest than in continuous forest. The frequency of 
colony foundations by sociotomy, or groups, was higher in contin- 
uous forests than forest edges. Mean colony life spans for interior 
forest colonies were significantly longer, as well as colony life 
spans of colonies founded by sociotomy when compared with soli- 
tary foundations. Colony extinctions did not demonstrate monthly 
variations, although colony foundations showed significant differ- 
ences, and were negatively correlated with monthly precipitation. 
We conclude that modes of colony foundation are habitat and sea- 
sonally dependent, related to the probability of survival.

TWO POLYGYNE OVERWINTERED NESTS OF 
VESPULA VULGARIS FROM CALIFORNIA 
Department of Entomology 
University of California 
Berkeley, CA 94720, USA 
Yellowjacket wasps, Vespula and Dolichovespula, form a mono- 
phyletic group in the family Vespidae (Carpenter, 1991). All 
species are eusocial or are social parasites of other yellowjackets 
(Greene, 1991). The colony life cycle is typically annual, with nest 
founding by lone queens in springtime. Reproductives are pro- 
duced sometime from summer to early winter, depending on the 
species and location, and the colony then dies out (Spradbery, 
1973; Akre et al., 1980; Greene, 1991). An interesting modifica- 
tion of this typical cycle is the occasional overwintering of a 
colony, giving rise to biennial or perennial colonies which usually 
contain multiple reproductive queens (Edwards, 1980; Ross and 
Matthews, 1982; Ross and Visscher, 1983; Greene, 1991; Sprad- 
bery, 1991). These polygyne colonies only occur in species that 
produce reproductives late in the year ("long-cycle" species), as in 
the V. vulgaris and V squamosa groups (Ross and Matthews, 
1982). Short cycle species, Dolichovespula and V rufa group, are 
not reported to give rise to polygyne colonies (Ross and Matthews, 
1982). Polygyne colonies are only found in areas with mild win- 
ters, such as North Africa, Florida, California, Australia, and New 
Zealand (Edwards, 1980), probably because insect prey is continu- 
ously available only in such areas. Gambino (1986) documented 
successful winter insect-prey capture by a V vulgaris colony in 
California. 
This study describes the nest contents of two overwintering 
nests of V vulgaris from California, where it is a native species. 
This is the first detailed information on this colony type in V vul- 
guris. Previous studies of overwintered nests are Gambino (1986), 
who studied prey collection, and Duncan (1939), who provided a 
Manuscript received 30 April 1992

brief description of nest contents. Both studies were done in 
California. 
Nest sites and collection 
Two overwintering nests of V vulgaris were reported to the Uni- 
versity of California at Berkeley Pest Management Service. One 
nest (colony 1) was located on the main campus, in the garden of 
the University Chancellor, and was collected on 28 January 1992. 
The other (colony 2) was located ca. 3 km north in the garden of 
the University President and was collected on 14 February 1992. 
Both were ground nests under redwood trees. The nests were cov- 
ered by 2-5 cm of soil, and 5-10 cm of redwood needles. These 
nest locations are typical of V. vulgaris (Akre et al., 1980). 
Nests were dug up early in the morning before appreciable for- 
aging began. Wasps were anaesthetized by pouring powdered dry 
ice into the entrance tube. We estimate that greater than 95% of all 
adult wasps and all the brood were collected by this method. 
Analysis of nest contents 
Each comb was measured for length and breadth, and comb area 
was calculated based on the formula for the area of an ellipse. The 
combined diameter of 10 adjacent cells was measured to estimate 
cell diameter. The number of cells in the comb was estimated by 
dividing comb area by cell area. In some combs cells of two sizes 
were found. Two combs were approximately equally divided into a 
patch of small cells and a patch of large cells. For these, the areas 
and diameters were measured for each patch separately. In each 
comb of colony 2 we counted the number of eggs per cell in ten 
cells, for cells located in the center of the comb, and for cells 
located around the periphery of the comb. The peripheral cells 
were typically newly constructed cells, whereas the central cells 
were being reused, as evidenced by the accumulated meconia. 
To determine the sex and caste of the brood we removed the 
contents of cells containing capped brood (i.e., cells covered by 
cocoon silk). Capped brood in the pupal stage were easily recog- 
nized as male, worker, or queen based on their size and antenna1 
length. Combs containing large numbers of capped brood were 
broken in half, and one half was uncapped. An estimate of the total 




================================================================================


Ratnieks & Miller 
number of pupae of each caste was obtained by first counting the 
total number of capped brood cells in the whole comb and in the 
half to be uncapped. Adult wasps were counted individually. 
Queens and workers were recognized by size. 
Reproductive status of queens and workers 
We classified the reproductive status of both queens and workers 
based on the length of the longest oocyte in either ovary. Females 
with no oocyte greater than 1 mm in length were classified as 
undeveloped; those with an oocyte greater than this were classified 
as developed. Fully developed eggs, obtained from the combs, 
measured 2.1 mm (Colony 1; S.D. = 0.06, n = 6) and 1.9 mm 
(Colony 2; S.D. = 0.10, n = 20). 
As a further measure of reproductive status we dissected the 
spermatheca from some queens. Individual sperm could easily be 
seen by squashing the spermatheca under a coverslip and examin- 
ing under high power. In some queens the number of sperm stored 
in the spermatheca was estimated by crushing the spermatheca in 
100 pl of saline, and counting in a hemacytometer slide using 
phase contrast. 
Nest structure and contents 
Nests were similar, with 10 and 11 combs, 2731 and 2235 adults, 
and 2575 and 2678 pupae respectively in Colonies 1 and 2 (Table 
1). Both nests contained large numbers of pupal and adult males, 
workers, and queens. Workers formed the majority of adults, 71% 
and 62%, but only 40% and 36% of the pupae. Except for the 
uppermost comb in Colony 1, all combs were being used for brood 
rearing and contained eggs and larvae. 
Most combs contained cells of a single size. However combs 5 
and 8 of Colony 2 contained 35% and 57% of large cells respec- 
tively. Comb 7 contained a 2 cm X 3 cm patch of small diameter 
cells. In colony 1 all combs contained cells of one size except for 
comb 6 which had a few large cells round the edge of a comb of 
small cells. 
Cells centrally located in the combs typically contained multiple 
eggs, but few cells on the edge of combs contained more than one 
egg (Table 1). Eggs were all laid by queens (see below) and were

================================================================================


19931 Ratnieks & Miller 47 
on the bottom surface of the cell, not on the sides as in perennial 
V. maculifrons (Ross and Visscher, 1983). 
Reproductive status of workers and queens 
Two hundred workers from each colony were dissected. None had 
developed ovaries. In yellowjacket nests the founder queen (i.e., 
the original mother) can usually be recognized based on worn 
appearance and enlarged abdomen. Although some of the queens in 
both nests had slight wear to the the wing tips and abdominal dis- 
coloration, none were highly worn or extremely physogastric. As a 
result, we think it unlikely that either colony contained the original 
founder queen. Queen ovary development and insemination are 
shown in Table 2. There was a highly significant association of 
insemination with ovary development (chi2 test, p < 0.001 in both 
cases), as previously reported in polygyne V. squamosa (Ross and 
Matthews, 1982). In Colony 2 the longest oocyte lengths of unin- 
seminated queens with developed ovaries were slightly lower, 1.85 
mm, (S.D. = 0.22, n = 9) than that of inseminated queens with 
developed ovaries, 1.95 mm, (S.D. = 0.18, n = 29). This difference 
is not significant (two sample t-test; p > 0.05). 
Sperm counts were made from 20 inseminated queens from each 
colony (Figure 1). There was considerable variance in sperm num- 
bers. In addition, queens from colony 1 had a lower mean number 
of sperm than those from colony 2, although this difference is not 
significant (two sample t-test; p > 0.05). Because queens in other 
Vespula species mate with multiple males (Ross, 1986), it is

possible that the low sperm counts of some queens may not repre-

The large numbers and proportions of workers, both adult and 
pupae, in the nests suggest that both colonies were thriving and 
would have survived indefinitely had they not been collected. 
Despite the apparent viability of these nests, they are nevertheless 
relatively rare. Over approximately the last decade? the campus 
Pest Management Service has only encountered three such nests, 
these two plus one other V vulgaris, while about 100 annual 
V vulgaris nests have been discovered (A. Slater, personal 
communication). 
The adult populations and numbers of cells in the two studied 
nests were in the mid-range, in comparison to other Vespula 
species (Spradbery, 1991) and were not appreciably greater than 
can be found in annual nests at the end of the year (Akre et al., 
1980). Because both nests were collected early in their second 




================================================================================


year? their final populations and sizes might have been much 
greater. Both nests were constructing new combs at the time of col- 
lection. The V vulgaris nest mentioned by Duncan (1939) con- 
tained approximately four gallons of adults (ca. 607000, Akre et al. 
19801, and were mostly workers. Overwintered nests of very high 
population also occur in other Vespula (Spradbery? 199 1). 
The absence of worker reproduction in these nests is interesting. 
Worker reproduction in first-year monogyne nests does not occur 
in two V vulgaris group species studied by Ross (1986). However, 
Ross and Visscher (1983) found considerable worker ovary-devel- 
opment in an overwintered polygyne colony of V maculifrons. 
Based on the total number of queens and the proportion of these 
with developed ovaries, approximately 100 queens in each nest 
were egg-laying? of which the majority were inseminated. Duncan 
(1939) reported 22 functional queens in the V vulgaris colony he 
studied, which were recognized by their frayed wing tips and backs 
worn free of setae. Because dissections were not made? it is possi- 
ble that this number is an underestimate of the actual number of 
egg-layers. The number of reproductive queens in overwintered 
Vespula nests ranges from one to 400 (Spradbery, 1991). 
Two overwintered nests of Vespula vulgaris were collected in Cali- 
fornia. The nests were similar, and contained: adult males: 5317 
589; adult workers: 1926? 1387; adult queens 274, 259; % adult 
workers with developed ovaries: 0, 0; % adult queens with devel- 
oped ovaries: 42? 4 1 ; pupal males: 1244? 1 120; pupal workers: 
101 1,964; pupal queens: 2607 594; combs 10, 11. 
Arthur Slater of UC Berkeley Pest Management Service told us 
about the nests and helped collect them. Kibi Schultz helped in the 
laboratory. Funding was provided by NSF grant BNS 9009197 to

FACTORS CONTROLLING DEALATION AND EGG LAYING 
IN VIRGIN QUEENS OF THE ARGENTINE ANT 
LINEPITHEMA HUMILE (MAYR) (= IRIDOMYRMEX HUMILIS) 
BY LUC PASSERA AND SERGE ARON 
In most ant species, reproduction is restricted to mated dealated 
queens. The reproductive life of queens usually starts at the time of 
colony founding just after mating. However, before mating, virgin 
queens remain for a more or less long period within the mother 
nest accumulating energy, waiting for sexual maturity and the 
appropriate weather conditions required for nuptial flight (Passera 
and Keller, 1992). Little is known about the biology of virgin 
queens during this maturation period, especially concerning their 
ability to lay eggs. Nevertheless, egg laying by virgin queens is of 
interest because unfertilized eggs could be an important source of 
male production, especially in species in which the workers are 
sterile (Brian, 1979). Data concerning reproduction by virgin 
queens are available only for the genus Solenopsis (Tschinkel and 
Howard, 1978; Voss, 1981). Two studies have demonstrated that 
virgin queens of several species within the S. geminata species 
complex are prevented from shedding their wings and from laying 
eggs in the presence of the mated mother queen (Fletcher and 
Blum, 198 1; Vargo and Porter, 1993). 
In this paper we study egg laying by virgin queens in the Argen- 
tine ant, Linepithema humile, and we investigate the factors 
involved in the control of this process. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Like many other tramp species, the Argentine ant is a polygy- 
nous and polydomous species with sterile workers (Passera, 1992). 
There is no mating flight; mating rapidly occurs in the nest 2-3 
days after the emergence of females, and colony founding is

accomplished by budding (Passera and Keller, 1992: Passera, 
1992). Because there is no inter-colony hostility in this species, 
individuals can be shifted between colonies readily. It is thus 
extremely easy to set up replicate experiments. 
Colonies used in this study originated from Port-Leucate on the 
western Mediterranean coast of France. After being brought to the 
laboratory, the ants were drawn out of the soil with the aid of a 
100-W incandescent lamp. They were housed in artificial nests 
covered with a black plastic box and maintained in the laboratory 
(Passera et al., 1988a). Under these conditions, queenless colony 
fragments rear sexuals (Passera et al., 1988a; Vargo and Passera, 
1991). In order to obtain winged virgin queens, females were iso- 
lated in the pupal stage and kept apart from other individuals. 
When necessary, winged and wingless queens were dissected in 
water using a dissecting microscope; we verified if the queen was 
inseminated from the presence of sperm, and recorded the absence 
or presence of developing eggs in the ovarioles and whether or not 
they contained corpora lutea in their bases. 
Dealation 
To study dealation of virgin queens over time, 298 winged 
queens, 0 to 24 h old, were set up in 15 queenless units (mean = 20 
winged queens per nest; SD = 9.8, range = 4-42) each containing 
about 600 workers; they were monitored weekly. Of these, 168 sur- 
vived long enough to shed their wings. Fig. 1 shows that the time 
of dealation is very variable, occurring from the first to the four- 
teenth week (mean = 5.2; SD = 3.5). 
Queen control over dealation 
To determine whether mated queens play a role in the ability of 
virgin queens to dealate, we compared dealation of virgin queens 
in 2 different experimental conditions. In the first series of experi- 
ments, we introduced 14 to 20 virgin queens (mean = 17, SD = 3.1) 
into 5 queenless units, whereas in the second series we introduced 
11 to 20 virgin queens (mean = 17, SD = 3.1) in 10 units each 
headed by 2 mated queens. All the virgin queens used were newly 
emerged (less than 24 h old). Dealation was monitored every 3 
days for 3 weeks. Fig. 2 clearly shows that dealation was lower in

queenright units. After 3 weeks, 72.6% and 13.7% of virgin queens 
dealated in queenless and queenright units, respectively. The dif- 
ference became statistically significant after day 9 (two-tailed, 
two-sample t-test = 4.59, P = 0.0005, square-root arc-sin trans- 
formed data). 
Another experiment was performed using winged virgin queens 
reared in pairs in experimental units headed by a mated queen (10 
replicates). The units were dequeened when the winged virgin 
queens were 7 weeks old, and the number of dealates present was 
recorded once a day (Fig. 3). In this case, almost 80% of the virgin 
queens shed their wings within 24 hours, and all of the 20 virgin 
queens involved in the experiment dealated before day 6. 
Egg laying by virgin queens 
Within 24 h after emergence, 219 winged virgin queens were 
housed in 10 units occupied by queenless workers originating from 
the same natal nest (mean = 20 virgin queens per nest; SD = 7.3, 
range = 10-31). Egg laying was monitored daily for 8 weeks and 
later twice a week for 6 additional weeks. After each observation, 
the observed dealated queens were removed from the experiment. 
In addition, 3 winged virgin queens were dissected each week. 
Even after 14 weeks, no eggs were observed in any of the 10 
experimental nests occupied by alates. All the dissections revealed 
that the spermathecae were empty, and in each case the ovaries 
were undeveloped and chorionated eggs were absent. 
The situation was different after dealation. Dealated virgin 
queens less than 15 days old (n = 211) were set up in 21 experi- 
mental nests with queenless workers (mean = 10 virgin queens per 
nest, SD = 9, range 1-33). Eggs were produced in all the 21 nests. 
Once the first eggs were laid, 1 virgin queen originating from each 
nest was dissected. All of the 21 queens had empty spermatheca 
but showed developed ovaries: their ovarioles contained chorion- 
ated eggs and small corpora lutea, indicating that they had laid 
eggs. The eggs were elliptical and pearly white. Their mean size 
was 0.3 mm long by 0.2 mm wide. They were very similar in size, 
shape and color to those laid by mated queens. 
The time needed for vitellogenesis to occur in dealated virgin 
queens was assessed in 8 subcolonies. It was compared to the time 
needed in 26 subcolonies containing newly mated queens. After

dealation, all the subcolonies were monitored daily and the time at 
which the first eggs were laid was recorded (Fig. 4). This delay 
was longer in virgin queens than in their mated counterparts: egg 
laying occurred after 17.8 days k 4.9 and 10.8 days k4.7 in virgin 
and mated queens, respectively (two-tailed two-sample t-test = 3.8, 
P = 0.0006, DF = 32, square-root transformed data). 
The development of eggs was monitored in 9 experimental sub- 
colonies headed by virgin queens. All of these nests reared only 
males, which emerged 47 to 63 days after the beginning of egg lay- 
ing. In two nests, males were able to mate with the dealated virgin 
queens (their mother), and workers emerged 1.5 months later. Two 
queens were dissected and had their spermathecae full of sperm 
indicating that they were mated. 
Behavior of newly dealated virgin queens 
Winged virgin queens were rarely seen outside the nest. Within 
21 days, we daily observed several dozen winged virgin queens, 
corresponding to 2760 occasions to locate the gynes. Only 6 times 
(0.2%) were winged virgin queens observed outside the nest, under 
the plastic box sheltering the nest. This behavior was suddenly 
altered at the time of dealation. Among 26 virgin queens observed

daily after they had shed their wings, 16 (61.5%) were seen outside 
the nest one day after dealation. This behavior faded rapidly later 
on, and the virgin queens were all seen inside the nest 8 days after 
dealation. 
The data reported in this paper are in agreement with those 
reported in several species of the genus Solenopsis by Fletcher and 
Blum (198 1, 1983) and Vargo and Porter (1 993). As observed in S. 
invicta and S. richteri, virgin queens of the Argentine ant are inhib- 
ited from shedding their wings in the presence of mated queens. 
However, the effect of queenlessness seems less pronounced than 
in Solenopsis: in S. invicta, dealation occurred in more than 60% 
of the virgin queens within 72 hours following dequeening 
(Fletcher and Blum, 1981). Similarly, 75% of virgin queens 
dealated within 1 week in queenless groups of S. richteri (Vargo 
and Porter, 1993). In our experiments, winged virgin queens of L. 
humile seem to react much more slowly than those of Solenopsis 
species when they were reared and maintained in queenless nests; 
only 20% of these virgin queens dealated within the first week. 
However, the difference is not so great if the age of the tested vir- 
gin queens is taken into account. In Solenopsis species the authors 
used virgin females of unknown age but most of them were several 
days or several weeks old. By contrast, our first experiment was 
conducted with virgin queens 1 day old at the time of dequeening. 
Our second experiment involved virgin queens 7 weeks old and 
gave similar results to those obtained in Solenopsis: all the virgin 
queens dealated within one week. We can hypothesize that in both 
genera, the older virgin queens dealated more easily than the 
younger ones did. 
In S. invicta several studies have demonstrated that a primer 
pheromone produced by the mated queens inhibits dealation of vir- 
gin queens (Fletcher and Blum, 1981, 1983). The amount of the 
inhibitory pheromone is linked to the weight and the fertility of the 
inseminated queens (Wilier and Fletcher, 1986). Evidence was 
reported by Sorensen et al. (1985) that this non-volatile substance 
is distributed to virgin queens by workers after physically contact- 
ing the mated queens. The role of such a queen pheromone, 




================================================================================


19931 Passera & Aron 59 
inhibiting dealation in L. humile, can be hypothesized, but we have 
no experimental evidence. The rather weak sensitivity of virgin 
queens to inhibitory factors produced by mated queens is consis- 
tent with the low number of mated queens still alive when virgin 
queens emerged. It is known that more than 90% of mated queens 
are executed by the workers before the rearing of queen larvae 
leading to a new cohort of virgin queens (Keller et al., 1989). 
Egg laying by virgin queens is rather common among ants, but 
authors generally have not paid attention to whether the egg laying 
queens have shed their wings. In Aphaenogaster fulva aquia Hask- 
ins and Enzmann (1945) observed that wingless virgin queens pro- 
duced eggs, but these authors give no information about egg laying 
by winged females. Results are similar for Lasius flavus (Goetsch 
and Kaethner, 1937), Leptothorax nylanderi (Plateaux, 1970), Mes- 
sor ebeninus (Tohmk, 1975) and Temnothorax recedens (Dejean, 
1974). In Monomorium pharaonis Buschinger and Petersen (1971) 
and Petersen and Buschinger (1971) reported that on at least one 
occasion oviposition began just after wing shedding. 
The total lack of vitellogenesis and, as a consequence, the 
absence of oviposition in winged virgin queens of the Argentine 
ant is an important finding. Although it is possible that maturation 
of the ovaries is a long process resulting in the absence of egg lay- 
ing, this is not the case in the Argentine ant: females reach sexual 
maturity within 2-3 days after emergence, and oviposition begins a 
few days after mating and dealation (Passera and Keller, 1992). As 
our results show, virgin queens retained their wings for several 
months and never oviposited. The link between dealation and the 
initiation of oviposition occurs in Solenopsis invicta but it is less 
pronounced in this latter species. Fletcher and Blum (1983) 
reported that 20% of the overwintered virgin alates were oviposit- 
ing in queenright field colonies. In contrast, their counterparts 
reared in spring did not lay eggs. These data demonstrate that egg 
laying by virgin alates in S. invicta is possible for virgin queens 
that remained in the nest for several months, whereas in the Argen- 
tine ant egg laying does not occur no matter how old the virgin 
alates. 
Virgin queens are also known to lay trophic (non-embryonated) 
eggs which are eaten by workers and larvae. For example, in Phei- 
dole pallidula unmated queens (winged or wingless) lay trophic 




================================================================================

eggs in queenright or queenless societies (Passera, 1978). The eggs 
laid by virgin queens are much larger than the reproductive ones 
laid by mated queens, and they are always non-embryonated 
(Passera, 1978). In S. invicta dealated virgin queens lay embry- 
onated eggs as well as trophic eggs, both being the same size 
(Kearney et al., 1977; Voss, 1981). everth he less, most of them are 
trophic eggs since less than 10% are viable (Vargo and Ross, 
1989). In the Argentine ant, we cannot identify two categories of 
eggs with respect to their size, because no attempts have been 
made to separate viable and non-viable eggs (by staining the chro- 
matine, for example); therefore, we do not know if trophic eggs are 
laid by virgin queens. 
Another interesting feature is that ovarian development is stimu- 
lated by wing shedding in L. humile. Mating is not necessary to 
accomplish this physiological event although egg laying is trig- 
gered more rapidly after insemination. In the Argentine ant virgin 
queens require 17.8 days after dealation to undergo vitellogenesis, 
whereas this period is only 10.8 days when dealation follows mat- 
ing. Our data are similar to those reported for S. invicta. In this 
species ovarian development is faster in mated queens than in vir- 
gin dealated queens; it requires 2-3 days in the former case 
(Markin et al., 1972) compared to 9-12 days in the latter (Glancey 
et al., 1981). These data suggest that mating plays a role in accel- 
erating ovarian development but not in triggering it. 
The shedding of the wings is also responsible for the dramatic 
behavioral changes observed in virgin females of L. humile. During 
the week following dealation, queens were frequently observed 
outside the nest. This behavior could be linked to an increase in the 
aggressiveness of the workers. Indeed, we showed that virgin 
alates are often attacked and killed by their workers (Passera and 
Aron, 1993). In S. invicta and S. richteri many reproductively 
active virgin wingless queens are executed during the week follow- 
ing dealation (Fletcher and Blum, 198 1 ; Vargo and Porter, 1993). 
Does reproduction by virgin queens play a significant role in the 
biology of the Argentine ant? Considering the low number of 
unmated queens in field colonies (2.1 %, Keller and Passera, 1992) 
and their weak fecundity, their contribution to male production is 
insignificant. The situation is quite different in S. invicta, in which 
the proportion of functional unmated queens in the polygynous 




================================================================================


19931 Passera & Aron 61 
form ranges from 26 to 30% (Vargo and Fletcher, 1987) and can 
reach 50% (Lofgren and Williams, 1984). In this species virgin 
queens may constitute an important source for male production. In 
the Argentine ant the advantage would thus lie elsewhere. This 
species moves rapidly and very often in response to environmental 
variation (Newel1 and Barber, 1913). Nest moving can result in dis- 
persal and isolation of virgin queens in nest fragments deprived of 
mated queens and males. Under such conditions, our results indi- 
cate that virgin queens dealate and soon lay viable eggs. Males 
reared from these eggs are capable of mating with the virgin 
queens, allowing the inseminated queens to become efficient repro- 
ductive females. This biological event can be compared to the 
process which leads to queen replacement in situ in dequeened 
colonies directly from brood present in the nest (Passera et al., 
1988). This phenomenon constitutes additional evidence that the 
Argentine ant exhibits unusual possibilities of queen replacement 
contributing to its ecological success. 
Mated queens of the Argentine ant Linepithema humile inhibit 
dealation of winged virgin queens. Winged virgin queens never lay 
eggs. In the absence of mated queens, virgin queens shed their 
wings when they are 1 to 14 weeks old. Wing shedding triggers 
vitellogenesis, and egg laying occurs an average of 18 days later. 
Egg laying results in the rearing of males which are capable of 
mating with their dealated virgin mother. Overall, mated queens of 
the Argentine ant have similar effects as Solenopsis queens. They 
control dealation and the egg laying of the virgin winged queens.

labor among size-castes (Wilson, 1980a, b). Foraging is generally 
performed by medium to large-size workers. At the nest, smaller 
workers prepare the retrieved material as a substrate for growing a 
fungus that the ants use for food. One characteristic generally con- 
sidered to distinguish the two genera of leaf-cutters is that only 
Atta species produce a soldier caste of large workers whose pri- 
mary function is nest defense (Weber, 1972). 
In earlier studies, I examined the foraging ecology of Atta 
cephalotes (L.) and Acromyrmex octospinosus echinatior Fore1 at 
La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica (Wetterer, 1990a, b, 
199la, b, ms). In the present study, I examined a third species of 
leaf-cutting ant common in this area, Acromyrmex volcanus 
Wheeler (Wheeler, 1937). 
A. cephalotes and Ac. octospinosus at La Selva show distinct 
ecological differences. A. cephalotes foragers usually carry fresh 
leaf fragments cut from large trees (also see Rockwood and 
Hubbell, 1987; Vasconcelos, 1990). In contrast, Ac. octospinosus 
foragers primarily cut herbs and scavenged on fallen leaves, fruits, 
flowers, and other plant material (Wetterer, 1991b). Compared 
with A. cephalotes, Ac. octospinosus foragers are on average larger 
and have a narrower range of body mass (Wetterer, 1991b). 
No previous study has examined the ecology of Ac. volcanus. 
My preliminary work indicated that Ac. volcanus is much like its 
close relative Ac. octospinosus. Ac. volcanus foragers, however,

are much larger in size and much darker in color than Ac. 
octospinosus foragers. 
In the present study, I measured forager mass, substrate selectiv- 
ity, and load size for Ac. volcanus foragers in the field. I compared 
these data with the findings from my earlier work with Ac. 
octospinosus. In addition, I located the nests of Ac. volcanus to 
describe and evaluate their nesting habits. 
The only previous published work on Ac. volcanus was its 
description based on seven foragers collected on "Volchn de 
Barba" (Volchn Barva) in Costa Rica (Wheeler, 1937). Wheeler 
(1937) originally gave this ant the name Ac. octospinosus vol- 
canus. However, because Ac. volcanus lives sympatrically with Ac. 
octospinosus echinatior yet remains completely distinct, it must be 
considered a separate species. A revision of the attine ants of Cen- 
tral America is currently in preparation (J. Longino, unpublished). 
My three study sites were all located on Volcan Barva, in North- 
central Costa Rica: La Selva Biological Station situated at the base 
of the volcano (altitude: 40 m), Plastico Biological Station (alti- 
tude: 560 m) and Rara Avis Reserve (altitude: 700 m). In addition 
to Ac. volcanus, I have found three other leaf-cutter species at 
these sites: Ac. octospinosus and A. cephalotes at La Selva and 
Plastico, and Ac. coronatus at Plastico and Rara Avis (Wetterer 
unpublished). Ac. volcanus is currently known from only one other 
site, Tortuguero National Park in Northeastern Costa Rica (J. 
Longino, personal communication). 
I collected foragers at six colonies of Ac. volcanus: three at La 
Selva (colonies LI, L2, and L3), one at Plastico (colony P), and 
two at Rara Avis (colonies Rl and R2). In July 1989 (wet season) 
and January 199 1 (dry season) I collected foragers from colony Ll . 
In June and July 1992 (wet season) I collected from colonies P and 
Rl. In February 1993 (dry season) I collected from colonies P, Rl, 
R2, L2, and L3. 
At each colony I collected consecutive ants on the main forag- 
ing trail. I placed each ant with her load in a separate vial. I 
weighed each ant and load to the nearest 0.1 mg on a Mettler Bal- 
ance, and scored each load as fresh (soft, pliant, and green) or 
fallen (dry or yellowed) leaf material (fragment or whole leaf),

herb section (stem or stem with leaves, leaf buds, or flowers), 
flower (part or whole), fruit (part or whole berry) or "other." 
At each colony I followed laden foragers in order to locate their 
nests. In addition, I partially excavated several nests. 
Foraging selectivity 
Ac. volcanus foragers carried a wide variety of vegetable matter 
(Table 1). I never found Ac. volcanus foragers cutting the leaves of 
large trees. The fresh leaf material that the ants cut came primarily 
from leaves of herbs. (The fresh leaf fragments of colony L3, how- 
ever, were cut from the thick succulent leaves of an epiphyte.) For- 
agers also commonly cut whole sections of herbs (herb stems and 
stems with leaves, leaf buds, or flowers). In addition, the foragers 
cut pieces of fallen leaves, fruits, and petals, and gathered fallen 
berries and flower buds, plus variable amounts of other types of 
plant material (petioles, seeds, bark, and wood slivers). Also, at 
colony Ll, I collected two Ac. volcanus foragers carrying small 
whole mushrooms. The ants at colony P in the wet season carried 
the highest proportion of dry leaf material. These consisted of 
fragments of grass blades dropped by A. cephalotes foragers near 
the entrance of a neighboring colony.

The general character of the vegetable material gathered by Ac. 
volcanus foragers was similar to that gathered by the Ac. 
octospinosus foragers (Table 1). However, the nature of fruit and 
flowers carried by the two species of Acromyrmex differed. Ac. 
volcanus foragers often took whole berries and whole flowers, 
whereas Ac. octospinosus foragers carried small pieces cut from 
larger fruits and flower petals (Wetterer, 199 1 b). 
Forager mass 
For all Ac. volcanus colonies combined, forager mass ranged 
from 19.1 to 41.5 mg, a 2.2-fold range. Mean forager mass varied 
somewhat among Ac. volcanus colonies (Table 2). This variation 
was consistent between wet and dry seasons. Each Ac. volcanus 
colony had a very narrow size-range of workers out foraging, from 
a 26% difference in mass between the smallest and largest forager 
to a 21 3% difference. 
The Ac. volcanus foragers were considerably larger than Ac. 
octospinosus foragers (Figure 1; Table 2). Weber (1972) reported 
that Ac. octospinosus was the largest of all Acromyrmex species 
with maxima workers weighing up to 15.6 mg. Wetterer (1991b) 
reported Ac. octospinosus foragers with masses of up to 21.2 mg

Psyche [VOI. 100 
(Table 2). In the present study, I found that all colonies of Ac. vol- 
canus had foragers of even greater mass than the largest Ac. 
octospinosus observed by Weber (1 972) and Wetterer (1 99 1 b). In 
fact, one colony of Ac. volcanus had foragers up to 41.5 mg in 
mass, more than twice the maximum reported by Weber (1972) for 
Ac. octospinosus. 
Load-mass selectivity 
Foragers from individual colonies of Ac. volcanus showed very 
little correlation between ant mass (m) and load mass (m) (Table 
2). In part, this is a result of the narrow size-range of foragers 
within a colony. Combining across colonies, however, there was a 
significant positive correlation between ant mass and load mass 
(Table 2, Figure 1). 
Burden (load masslant mass) ranged from 0.03 to 5.2. Only 2% 
of the ants carried loads greater than four times their own mass 
(Figure 1). Overall, Ac. volcanus foragers carried loads that aver- 
aged 1.2 times their own mass (Table 2). Mean burden varied 
among colonies, largely due to differences in load type. For exam- 
ple, the lowest mean burden was for colony P (wet season) where a 
large portion of the ants carried very light pieces of dried grass and 
fragments from thin fern leaves. The greatest mean burdens were at 
colony Ll (wet season) where many ants carried whole berries and 
at colony L3 where many ants carried whole flower buds and fresh 
fragments cut from the thick leaves of an epiphyte. 
The overall pattern of load mass selection by Ac. volcanus for- 
agers was similar to that of Ac. octospinosus foragers (Table 2; for 
Ac. octospinosus, mean burden = 1.4, range = 0.02-5.8, 5% with 
burdens greater than 4; Wetterer 199 1 b). However, because Ac. 
volcanus foragers were on average more than twice the mass of Ac. 
octospinosus foragers (Table 2), their average load mass was about 
twice as large (mean load mass was 36.5 k 29.8 mg for Ac. vol- 
canus versus 19.5 k 18.8 mg for Ac. octospinosus). 
Nesting habits 
In addition to the six colonies examined above, I located seven 
additional Ac. volcanus colonies: two at La Selva, two at Plastico, 
and three at Rara Avis. The La Selva and Rara Avis colonies were 
all located in primary forest. The Plastico colonies were all located 
in open pasture. 




================================================================================


19931 Wetterer 71 
At La Selva, all Ac. volcanus nests appeared to be situated up in 
trees. All laden foragers disappeared into the canopy, usually via 
several vines hanging from a large tree. Only once did I actually 
find an Ac. volcanus nest at La Selva. It was set under a pile of 
organic debris in the crotch between tree limbs. At the other Ac. 
volcanus colonies, I was unable to find laden foragers descending 
any nearby trees, so I presumed the nests were in the trees that the 
ants were ascending. J. Longino (personal communication) found 
one nest of Ac. volcanus at La Selva, and it was under organic 
debris in the crotch of a tree. 
There were no large trees at Plastico. Instead, all three nests of 
Ac. volcanus that I located there were at the top edge of road banks 
directly under the root mats of the grass, ferns, and herbs. Colony 
P was bordered on two sides by A. cephalotes nests (both with 
entrances lower in the road bank). The foraging trails of colony P 
appeared to end at the nest entrances of these two other colonies 
suggesting possible interspecific territoriality. 
At Rara Avis, two of the five Ac. volcanus colonies (colony R2 
and one other) were apparently in trees. The other three colonies 
were on the ground under organic debris: colony Rl was at the 
base of a rotted tree trunk under about 15 cm of organic debris, a 
second colony was in the roots of a stilted palm, and a third was 
under a pile of debris from a rotted log. Curiously, the first two of 
these colonies on the ground were located within 40 cm of a nest 
of Paraponera clavata, the highly aggressive "bala" ant. At La 
Selva I have often seen P. clavata foragers on trails of both Ac. 
volcanus and Ac. octospinosus, suggesting a possible association. 
Thus, at each of the three sites, Ac. volcanus showed different 
nesting habits. In all cases, however, the nests were built not under 
soil, but under loose organic debris. 
When I excavated a nest, large workers that function as foragers 
streamed out and attacked my hands. Although these workers were 
the size of small A. cephalotes soldiers, their bites were relatively 
feeble in comparison to equivalent-sized A. cephalotes soldiers, 
which easily draw blood. 
Whereas I found only very large Ac. volcanus workers foraging, 
within the nests there are a wide size-range of workers (as small as 
0.8 mg; Wetterer, unpublished). The smaller workers are all lighter 
in color than the large foragers. Also within the nests, I found 




================================================================================


Psyche [vo~. 100 
many light-colored workers of forager size. Almost certainly, these 
were callow (newly eclosed) workers. Only twice have I observed 
such light-colored workers outside the nest. All foragers collected 
in this study were darker, mature workers. Fowler (1983) noted 
that callow workers in Atta texana rarely foraged. Such temporal 
polyethism, division of labor by age, is almost universal among 
ants (Holldobler and Wilson, 1990). Typically, young workers care 
for the brood and tend to other tasks within the nest, whereas older 
workers tend to nest construction, nest defense, and foraging. 
The foraging ecology of Ac. volcanus appears to be similar to 
that of its congener Ac. octospinosus. Both species primarily cut 
the leaves and other parts of small herbs and scavenge on fallen 
leaves, fruits, and flowers. Such selectivity is strikingly different 
from that of the sympatric leaf-cutter, A. cephalotes. Although 
some A. cephalotes foragers carry a variety of vegetable matter, the 
majority of foragers carry fresh leaf fragments cut from trees 
(Rockwood and Hubbell, 1987; Vasconcelos, 1990; Wetterer, 
l99Oa). 
Foragers of both Ac. volcanus and Ac. octospinosus are larger 
and with a narrower range of body mass than A. cephalotes for- 
agers. Mean forager mass in A. cephalotes varies greatly among 
colonies and among trees attacked by any one colony (range of 
mean forager mass attacking individual trees: 4.2-1 1.1 mg; overall 
mean mass -7 mg; Wetterer, 1990a, ms). Even for A. cephalotes 
attacking an individual tree, the size-range of foragers is consider- 
ably broader than the 2.2-fold range of Ac. volcanus foragers for 
all colonies combined (typical mass range for A. cephalotes for- 
agers attacking individual trees: 5- to 10-fold, coefficient of varia- 
tion (meanISD): 0.3-0.7; Wetterer, l99Oa, ms). 
The differences in forager polymorphism between A. cephalotes 
and the two species of Acromyrmex may represent different forag- 
ing strategies that allow each species to harvest efficiently its pre- 
ferred vegetation resources. A. cephalotes foragers often mass 
recruit to large trees in prolonged attacks lasting up to several 
days. In these attacks, the mass of recruited foragers is matched to 
the leaf source, with larger foragers attacking trees with thicker 
and tougher leaves (Nichols-Orians and Schultz, 1989; Wetterer, 




================================================================================


19931 Wetterer 73 
1990a, ms). The match of forager mass to leaf type increases both 
cutting efficiency (Wilson, 1980b) and transport efficiency (Wet- 
terer, ms). Extreme polymorphism among foragers broadens the 
diversity of tree species that can be exploited efficiently. For 
species such as Ac. octospinosus and Ac. volcanus that depend pri- 
marily on cutting or collecting vegetation at small, ephemeral 
sources, matching worker size to resource type during the short 
duration of each attack at individual source may be economically 
impractical. A forager caste of a single optimal size that is large 
enough to harvest vegetation at all encountered sources may be 
more efficient. 
Whereas the foraging ecology of Ac. volcanus is generally simi- 
lar to its congener Ac. octospinosus, there is a striking difference 
in forager mass between these two species. The adaptive function 
of this difference may be related to Ac. volcanus' habit of collect- 
ing whole flowers, flower buds, and berries and cutting the thick 
leaves of epiphytes, tasks that require a larger forager caste. 
The large size of Ac. volcanus foragers rivals the mass of typical 
soldiers of some Atta species, such as Atta colombica Guerin (Wet- 
terer, unpublished data). A. colombica "soldiers" commonly forage 
(Wetterer, unpublished data) and the "foragers" of Ac. volcanus 
also act as soldiers, thus blurring one characteristic generally con- 
sidered to distinguish the two genera (i.e., the presence of a soldier 
caste). 
The terrestrial and arboreal nesting habits of Ac. volcanus were 
typical for Acromyrmex, and particularly similar to those reported 
for the other two Acromyrmex species known to occur in Costa 
Rica, Ac. octospinosus and Ac. coronatus. Ac. octospinosus typi- 
cally nests in the soil (commonly in road banks), but also nests 
above the soil (Weber, 1945; Wetterer, personal observation). At 
La Selva, I most commonly found Ac. octospinosus nests in the 
soil at the base of trees. Only once did I find an Ac. octospinosus 
trail going up a tree presumably to an arboreal nest. Weber (1946) 
found Ac. coronatus nests "above ground, under fallen logs or in 
masses of rotted wood and humus on the buttress roots of fallen 
logs, covered by a loose layer of dead leaf fragments." 
Further research is needed to confirm whether Ac. volcanus 
nesting habits are strictly arboreal at La Selva and at other low ele- 
vation sites, but more terrestrial at higher elevation and, if so, to 
determine the ecological significance of this shift in nesting habit. 




================================================================================


74 Psyche [vo~. 100 
At lower elevation sites Ac. volcanus may be driven into the trees 
by greater competition from other ants (A. Bien, personal commu- 
nication) or perhaps by greater predation pressure. 
Ac. volcanus is more apparent at Plastico and Rara Avis than at 
La Selva. This difference, however, may not be due to a difference 
in abundance. At Rara Avis, Ac. volcanus may be more noticeable 
simply because it is the only common leaf-cutter present; Atta 
cephalutes, which is very common at La Selva and Plastico, is 
absent at Rara Avis. At Plastico, Ac. volcanus may be more appar- 
ent because of its terrestrial habits there and because it nests in 
road banks which are relatively clear of vegetation. It is possible 
that Ac. volcanus is quite abundant in the treetops of La Selva and 
other lowland forests in Central America. Ac. volcanus may be 
much more common and ecologically important than generally 
appreciated and certainly deserves additional study. 
I examined the foraging and nesting ecology of Acromyrmex 
volcanus Wheeler, a leaf-cutting ant known only from Northeast- 
ern Costa Rica. No previous study has examined any aspect of the 
ecology of this species. I compared its ecology with that of a close 
relative, the common and widespread Acromyrmex octospinosus 
Forel. 
I found that Ac. volcanus depends heavily on cutting herbs and 
collecting pieces of fallen vegetation, such as dead leaves, fruit, 
petals, flower buds, and seeds. Such foraging selectivity is gener- 
ally similar to that of Ac. octospinosus, although the nature of fruit 
and flower material carried by these two species of Acromyrmex 
differs. Ac. volcanus foragers often take whole berries and whole 
flowers and flower buds, whereas Ac. octospinosus foragers cut 
small pieces from larger fruits and flower petals. 
Despite a 50-fold range in worker mass within the nest (0.8 to 
-40 mg), Ac. volcanus foragers are relatively monomorphic, with 
only the very largest workers (>20 mg) foraging. Such a pattern is 
again similar to that of Ac. octospinosus. Ac. volcanus foragers, 
however, are on average more than twice the mass of Ac. 
octospinosus foragers (3 1 mg vs. 13 mg). In fact, Ac. volcanus has 
the largest workers of any species of Acromyrmex. 




================================================================================


19931 wetterer 75 
Ac. volcanus appears to nest most commonly in trees, but also 
nests on the ground. In both situations, the nests are found under 
several centimeters of organic debris. These nesting habits are typ- 
ical of Acromyrmex. Ac. volcanus appears to be more arboreal in 
nature than Ac. octospinosus. 
The large monomorphic foragers of Ac. volcanus and Ac. 
octospinosus appear to be well suited as generalist foragers, able to 
cut or collect any desirable vegetation encountered. Additional 
studies are needed to evaluate the ecological differences between 
these two species.

A NEW SPECIES OF THE GENUS STROTOCERA 
SCHENKLING (COLEOPTERA: CLERIDAE: TILLINAE) 
FROM THE BALTIC AMBER 
Department of Entomology 
Museum of Comparative Zoology 
Harvard University 
Cambridge, MA 02138 USA 
The genus Strotocera Schenkling contains seventeen extant 
species, of which two are found in southeast Asia and fifteen are 
generally distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa (Corporaal 
1950: 15-16; Pic 1953: 320; Ekis 1975: 11). Strotocera may be 
distinguished from a related complex of genera by means of the 
key given by Schenkling (1903: 3-4). The specific-level taxonomy 
of Strotocera is based at present on characters of coloration, and 
several specific synonymies undoubtedly exist in this genus. Noth- 
ing has been published on the biology of these beetles, although 
specimens may be found in most of the world's major museums 
(see Materials below). 
I was recently given a poorly preserved specimen of a new 
species of Strotocera from the Baltic Amber which was discovered 
by Christopher J. Marshall (now of Cornell University) while con- 
ducting curatorial work in the fossil insect collection of the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology. Although this specimen has lost 
whatever coloration it may have possessed during the process of 
diagenesis, its structural morphology is sufficiently preserved to 
warrant description and preliminary comparison with that of extant 
species of Strotocera. Because of the extensive fracturing of the 
amber surrounding this fossil, it was not possible to photograph the 
specimen.

overall length, the structure of its profemora, the shape of the 
subapical depression of its pronotum, and the robustness of 
its pronotum proper. However, it shares at least three charac- 
ters with the group of species typified by the Indonesian 
species Strotocera grandis Schenkling: its planate pronotal 
collar which is only slightly constricted basally; the glabrous 
area surrounding its eyes; and the arrangement of its elytral 
punctures. 
Many clerid genera, including Strotocera, share a present-day 
discontinous distribution which includes sub-Saharan Africa and 
southeast Asia (see Table 1). The most parsimonious explanation 
for this distribution pattern is that the ranges of these clerid genera 
were at one time continuous across southern Asia into Europe and 
Africa. The presence of tropical clerid genera such as Strotocera 
and Orthrius Gorham (Menier 1983: 163-165) in the Baltic Amber 
certainly lends weight to this hypothesis. However, the alternative 
hypothesis, independent evolution of generic characters in African 
and southeast Asian Cleridae, cannot be ruled out, particularly in 
the case of the poorly defined genera of the large generic complex 
typified by the genus Stigmatium Gray. Further studies of clerid 
inclusions in the Baltic Amber such as that of Winkler (1990: 
371-381) may clarify these questions of clerid phylogeny and zoo- 
geography.

Strotocera marshalli NEW SPECIES (Coleoptera: Cleridae: Til- 
linae) is described from a specimen preserved in Baltic Amber. A 
preliminary assessment of the relationships of this new species is 
provided. In the opinion of the author, the study of Baltic Amber 
fossils is essential to understanding present-day discontinuous dis- 
tributions in clerid genera such as Strotocera Schenkling.

QUEEN POLYMORPHISM IN AN AUSTRALIAN WEAVER 
ANT, POLYRHACHIS CF. DODDI 
Theodor-Boveri-Institut, 
LS Verhaltensphysiologie und Soziobiologie,

The morphological features which distinguish an ant queen 
from the worker caste have recently become of special interest to 
myrmecologists again. The discovery of wingless queens in numer- 
ous species has not only initiated a debate on how to name female 
reproductives with aberrant morphology (Buschinger 1987, Peeters 
and Crozier 1988, Loiselle and Francoeur 1989, Peeters 1991, Vil- 
let 1992), but it has also stimulated several studies on the evolu- 
tionary significance of wing reduction in ant queens (Bolton 1986, 
Villet 1989, Tinaut and Heinze 1992, Buschinger and Heinze 
1992). Queen polymorphism, the co-occurrence of two or more 
morphologically distinct types of queens within a single species, is 
of special interest because it can give insights into the processes of 
morphological caste differentiation in ants. Furthermore, it is fre- 
quently correlated with dispersal polymorphism, the maintenance 
of which is poorly understood (e.g., Heinze 1989, Buschinger and 
Heinze 1992). 
In the Australian weaver ant Polyrhachis (Cyrtomyrma) cf. 
doddi Bellas and Holldobler (1985) discovered two different sizes 
of queens. We here describe the morphological characteristics of 
queen polymorphism in this species. 
Colonies of Polyrhachis cf. doddi were collected between June 
and August 1980 near Port Douglas, North Queensland, Australia, 
and preserved in alcohol. Measurements of alitrunk length 
(Weber's), maximal width of alitrunk (mesonotum), and the 
Manuscript received 15 March 1993.

maximal length of the scutum in dorsal view were made at 25X 
magnification using a binocular microscope. 
Variation of queen size was examined in 52 queens (including 
virgin female sexuals) from five colonies of I? cf. doddi (Fig. 1). 
The largest queens in this sample had an alitrunk length (Weber's) 
of 3.4mm, while the smallest measured 2.2mm and thus were only 
little longer than the average worker (n=18, 2.0mm, S.D. 0.1mm).

================================================================================

The alitrunk width varied between 1.2mm and 2.0mm. In compari- 
son the mean alitrunk width of 18 workers was 1.3mm. S.D. 
0.05mm. 
Size distribution of queens of P. cf. doddi in our sample is 
slightly bimodal, though large and small morphs were not com- 
pletely separated (Fig. 2a). The limited number of colonies avail- 
able for this study, however, does not allow conclusions on the size 
distribution of queens in the field. In three of five examined 
colonies, large and small queens co-occurred. One colony con- 
tained two queens of intermediate size, and in one colony only 
small queens were found. 
Variation in size is associated with differences in the structure 
of the mesonotum and wing development. In all queens, a complete 
set of thoracic sclerites was retained but the relative size of the 
mesonotum varied considerably. In some queens, the scutum 
strongly extended anteriorly and in dorsal view completely covered 
the pronotum, whereas in others it was more or less reduced (Fig. 
3). This variation is probably best described by the ratio between 
scutum length and alitrunk length (index A, Tinaut and Ruano, 
1992), which in P. cf. doddi ranged between 0.34 and 0.54. Large 
queens invariably had a strongly developed scutum, while in small 
queens relative scutum size differed widely (Fig. 2b). The poly- 
morphism of the alitrunk is accompanied by changes in wing mor- 
phology. All examined dealate queens had wing remnants, 
regardless of size and structure of the mesonotum. However, large 
alates typically had normal, long wings, whereas the small queens 
had vestigial wings, resembling the rudimentary wings of irregu- 
larly occurring "winged workers" in other ant species (Wheeler 
1905; Ezhikov 1934; Fig. 4) or normal wings reduced in size 
(Fig. 5). 
Morphological variation corresponds with differences in the 
number of ovarioles. Approximately 86% of the large queens that 
were dissected proved to be inseminated, and all had fully devel- 
oped active ovaries (17-22 ovarioles); only 36% of the small 
queens were inseminated, and 58% had fully developed ovaries 
(14-17 ovarioles). Worker ovaries consisted of 2 to 4 ovarioles 
(Bellas and Holldobler 1985).

Polyrhachis cf. doddi in dorsal view. The scale equals 1 cm. 
Queens in the colonies of the Australian weaver ant, 
Polyrhachis cf. doddi, show a surprisingly large variability in size 
and morphology. In an earlier study on gland constituents in this 
species (Bellas and Holldobler 1985) it was briefly speculated that 
small queens might belong to another species, conceivably a social 
parasite. However, as we show in this study, large and small queens 
in colonies of P. doddi are but the extremes of a continuous, 
though probably bimodal size variation. Hence we think that large 
and small queens do not belong to separate species but represent a 
peculiar case of intraspecific queen polymorphism. 
In most cases of queen polymorphism described as yet, winged 
queens co-occur with wingless queens, whose thoracic sclerites are 
more or less fused (Heinze and Buschinger, 1987; Heinze et al., 
1992). In other cases, such as Myrmica spp. (Elmes, 1991) or 
Pseudomyrmex venefica (Janzen, 1973), queen size shows a 
bimodal distribution without conspicuous changes in alitrunk mor- 
phology, i.e. small queens (microgynes) are isometric reductions of 
the larger ones. In Polyrhachis cf. doddi, all queens retain the full

set of thoracic sclerites and are winged; however, in small queens 
scutum and wings may be greatly reduced. 
The development of the scutum, especially the relation of scu- 
turn length and alitrunk length, appears to be a good indicator of 
flight capability of winged queens. According to Tinaut and Ruano 
(1992), species whose queens have a large scutum, which in dorsal 
view fully covers the pronotum ("macronotal," Wheeler 19 17), 
have a swarming flight, whereas in most species with less devel- 
oped scutum in the queens mating occurs on the ground. Though 
the sexual behavior of Polyrhachis cf. doddi queens is not known, 
from the morphology it appears that all large queens, but also some 
small queens, are capable of flying, whereas the reduction of wings

and the reduced mesonotum of many of the small queens certainly 
does not permit flight. The two queen morphs in P. cf. doddi prob- 
ably follow different dispersal and colony founding strategies as 
was reported for several other queen-polymorphic ants (Briese, 
1983; Heinze, 1989; Buschinger and Heinze, 1992). New habitat 
islands might thus be colonized by large, long-winged queens 
through solitary colony founding, whereas a single habitat patch 
might be fully exploited by colony fission or budding after readop- 
tion of small, short-winged queens. 
As was shown by Bellas and Holldobler (1985), both large and 
small queens may co-occur in single nests and both types of 
queens have been found to be inseminated and lay eggs. Polygyny 
in Polyrhachis has occasionally been reported (Yamauchi et al., 
1987; Kohout, 1988; Chen Yi and Tang Jue, 1989), but appears to 
be absent or rare in most species. 
The polymorphism of queens found in colonies of the Aus- 
tralian weaver ant, Polyrhachis cf. doddi is described. Body size, 
wing length, and especially the development of the mesonotum 
show enormous variation. However, in all queens the full set of 
thoracic sclerites is retained.

NATURAL HISTORY AND BEHAVIOR OF TWO SPECIES OF 
MACROHALTICA (COLEOPTERA: CHRYSOMELIDAE) 
BY W. EBERHARD"~, R. ACHOY~, M. C. MAR IN^, AND J. UGALDE~'~ 
The genus Macrohaltica and the allied genus Altica have 
approximately 30 described species in Central America and per- 
haps 200 or more worldwide (R. White pers. comm.). Larvae and 
adults often feed on onagraceous and ericaceous plants (Scherer 
1969, Phillips 1977a), though other plants are also utilized (Woods 
1918, Balsbaugh and Hays 1972, Phillips 1977a, Barstow and Git- 
tins 1973, LeSage 1990). Some species of Macrohaltica are con- 
sidered secondary pests of crops in Costa Rica (King and Saunders 
1984). Some species are difficult to distinguish morphologically 
(Phillips 1977b), and both parthenogenesis and interspecific 
hybridization are known (Phillips 1977a, 1979). 
This paper describes aspects of the natural history and behavior 
of a pair of species in the central highlands of Costa Rica, a metal- 
lic blue species M. jamaicensis (hereafter M. j.), and an apparently 
undescribed metallic purple species (hereafter M. sp.). The beetles 
frequently attract attention because they aggregate, sometimes in 
masses of up to several thousand individuals. A second striking 
trait is that some aggregations include individuals of both species, 
and cross-specific male-female pairs are common in such aggrega- 
tions. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Observations were made over a span of nine years, during which 
time we saw many tens of thousands of beetles in the field, and 
raised thousands in captivity. The behavior of beetles in four 
aggregations was observed in detail: 
Aggregation I - both species on Ludwigia octovalvis (Ona- 
graceae) plants near San Antonio de Escazu, el. 1300 m, 27

June-13 July 1983). In this and other field observations, adults of 
M. sp. were identified by their purple color; since Fl hybrids 
between the species are also purple (R. Achoy unpub. thesis), these 
identifications are somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless hybrid indi- 
viduals (distinguished by genitalic characters) are uncommon in 
the field (Eberhard and Ugalde in prep.); 
Aggregation I1 - M. j. on Cuphea sp. (Litraceae) plants near the 
edge of a lawn near San Vito de Java, el. 1000 m, 23-25 Jan. 1987; 
Aggregation I11 - M. sp. on low grass in a pasture near Mon- 
teverde, el. 1300 m, 14-15 Feb. 1985; and 
Aggregation IV - M. sp. on various plants along approximately 
50 m of a roadside above San Antonio de Escazu, el. 1400 m, 
Feb-June, 1992. These and other sites mentioned in the text are 
shown in Fig. 1. 
All beetles in Aggregation I were counted on 12 nights. Each 
night all unmarked pairs of males and females were marked on the 
dorsal surface with airplane enamel (two spots for males, one for 
females). Unmarked solitary beetles were not marked. 
Beetles were raised in captivity in San Jose with ambient tem- 
peratures and light cycles. Larvae were fed freshly cut leaves in 
petri dishes, and adults were fed either the same or kept in plastic 
bags on branches of potted food plants. When larvae ceased feed- 
ing and began wandering, they were placed in containers with soft 
soil where they could pupate. 
Experiments on preferences for pupation substrates were per- 
formed as follows. An approximately cylindrical plastic cup (8.8 
cm in diameter at the mouth) was placed in the center of an 
approximately cylindrical, larger plastic container (16.0 cm in 
diameter at the mouth). The cup was filled to the brim with one 
substrate and set in the center of the larger container, which was 
then filled to the brim of the cup with the other substrate. Larvae 
placed on the surface thus had access to both types of substrate 
(60.8 cm2 of the substrate in the cup, 140.3 cm2 of that in the 
larger container). Neither type of soil was compacted. After the 
larvae (30-40 per repetition) had disappeared underground, the 
smaller container was removed from the larger, and the numbers of 
adults reared from each were recorded. In replica experiments sub- 
strates in the larger and smaller containers were reversed. 
Voucher specimens of adult beetles are deposited in the U. S. 
National Museum, the British Museum (Natural History), and the

Unless noted otherwise, all statistical tests were two-tailed Chi 
squared tests. Averages are followed by one standard deviation. 
Altitudinal Range 
The altitudinal ranges of the two species differed. The highest 
and lowest sites at which we found M. sp. were approximately 
2300 m on Cerro de la Muerte, and about 1000 m near San Rafael 
de Escazu; M. j. was absent at higher elevations, occurring from

San Josecito de San Isidro de Heredia and above San Antonio de 
Escazu (both about 1400 m) to San Rafael de Escazu (1000 m). 
Life Cycle 
Both species were raised from egg to adult in captivity. Approx- 
imate durations of immature life stages were 5 days for the egg, 21 
for the larva, and 14 for the pupa, but durations of the larval stage 
varied somewhat for both species on different host plants (Table 1). 
The longest adult life in captivity was 94 days for a female M. j. (a 
Fl hybrid female lived 99 days). Eggs were about 1.2 mm long, 
oval in shape, and yellowish in color. They did not have the fecal 
streak found on the eggs of some Altica spp. (Woods 1917, Phillips 
1977a). Each egg was covered with a highly reticulate mesh of a 
white, somewhat extensible, adhesive material. When the egg was 
dry this covering gave it a white color. When a group of 50 newly- 
laid eggs (<24 hr old) was tasted, they produced a burning sensa- 
tion similar to that of the larvae (below) but weaker. 
Oviposition behavior of M. j. was observed in captivity. The 
female made repeated brief, apparently exploratory extensions of 
her genitalia against the substrate before ovipositing. The pair of 
coxites, which bear setae which are probably chemosensory and/or

Eggs were found on the leaves of all three genera of host plants. 
Those of M. sp. on the large G. insignis leaves, which were up to 
more than 1 m in diameter, were usually solitary, each alongside a 
vein of the leaf; in a sample of 728 eggs, there was one group of 9, 
3 of 3, 20 of 2, while all the other 670 eggs were not within .5 mm 
of another egg (average group size = 1.05k0.37). In contrast, the 
eggs of M. j. were much more often grouped (av. group size = 
10.9k10.9, range 1-59, n=1341) on the thinner and much smaller 
leaves of Ludwigia octovalvis (about 1 cm wide). Eggs of M. j. on 
L. octovalvis were nearly always on the underside of the leaf (70 of 
74 groups). In captivity M. j. also laid eggs in tight spaces such as 
the crack between the top and bottom of a petri dish. 
Eggs of M. j. generally failed to hatch unless they were quite 
humid. Thus eggs laid on leaves of potted L. octovalvis plants in 
the lab (where neither rain nor dew wet the eggs) late in the wet 
season (Oct. 1991) often failed to produce larvae (only 21.9% of 
2061 eggs in 54 groups hatched); at least one egg hatched in only 
16 of 54 groups laid by 5 females (branches with eggs were 
enclosed in small plastic sandwich bags with many small holes). In 
the early dry season (Nov. 1991) hatching success was even lower 
(16 of 128 groups laid by 12 females, p<0.01). In contrast, when 
leaves on which eggs had recently been laid were placed on filter 
paper or paper napkins saturated with water in small, culture 
dishes, hatching success was much higher (79% of 506 eggs; 39 of 
39 groups had at least one egg hatch) (p<0.001 compared with 
groups of eggs on leaves). 
Survivorship of eggs and larvae on plants where adults were 
aggregated was probably reduced. Aggregations of adults some- 
times completely stripped G. insignis leaves and entire Cuphea and 
Ludwigia plants (Fig. 2), so eggs could be consumed along with 
the plant. We observed captive adults eating eggs laid on the walls 
of petri dishes. Larvae which eclosed on plants with aggregations 
of adults also ran the risk of not having adequate food. Females of 
at least M. sp. tended to oviposit on leaves where adults were not 
aggregated. Inspection of 16 pairs of G. insignis leaves, one with 
an aggregation of adults and the other the nearest relatively 
uneaten leaf of the same plant, showed that even though M. sp. 
beetles were seldom seen away from aggregations, the densities of 
eggs (eggs/cm2) were lower on the occupied leaves: average densi- 
ties were 4.28å±7.01/cm (range 0-26.4) vs. 6.71k6.96/cm2 (range

0-28.2) (in 13 of 16 pairs the density on the unoccupied leaf was 
higher, p<0.01). 
Larvae remained on the host plant day and night. Although lar- 
val coloration was not aposematic (pale brownish yellow or orange 
with black head capsule, legs, and bristles), some larvae of both 
species had a strongly disagreeable taste. Recently moulted third 
instar larvae (mostly black in color) had little or no taste, but fully 
grown larvae (mostly orange in color) of M. sp. on G. insignis 
plants produced a delayed but powerful burning sensation. When 
one entire larva was tasted, the burning began about 30 sec later, 
and lasted for more than 15 minutes. A larva of M. j. on a L. octo- 
valvis plant and an adult M. sp. on a G. insignis plant had a similar, 
though less intense taste (larvae were identified by association 
with nearby monospecific aggregations of adults). 
First instar larvae generally began feeding in a group near eggs 
from which they hatched, but older larvae did not aggregate as they 
fed. The average number of M. j. larvae per occupied leaf on two 
L. octovalvis plants was 1.8 å 1.8 (N = 57 leaves with larvae). 
Early instar larvae of both species usually fed on only the lower 
layers of the leaf, leaving the upper side intact. Later instars ate 
entire leaves of Ludwigia spp., but usually left one (usually the 
upper) side of the much thicker G. insignis leaves intact. Larval 
damage to G. insignis leaves was thus easily distinguished from 
that produced by adults, as in some Altica (Woods 1917, 191 8). 
Larvae on Ludwigia plants which had been stripped of leaves also 
fed on the cuticle of stems and fruits. Although there was substan- 
tial variation, it appeared that M. j. larvae tended to feed on leaves 
lower down on L. octovalvis plants. 
Larvae left host plants to search for appropriate pupation sites. 
In nature mature larvae of M. sp. (identified as such by heavily 
damaged Gunnera plants and the absence of Ludwigia or Cuphea 
plants nearby) were seen crawling on the ground 5 m from the 
nearest plant with larval feeding damage; mature M. j. larvae 
(identified by raising them to adults) were found to up to >1 m 
from the base of the nearest L. octovalvis. 
Active selection of pupation sites was demonstrated experimen- 
tally in M. j. When offered either rich humus or sandy soil, larvae 
tended to pupate in humus: 74 vs. 1 adults were raised in two repli- 
cas with sandy soil in the central portion, 57 vs. 13 in two replicas 
with sandy soil on the periphery (ratio of area in center: periphery

= 1:2.31, p<0.001). Although their food plants generally grow in 
sites with waterlogged soil, larvae preferred to pupate in drier soil. 
When offered either humus soil with water barely standing 
(approximately 43% water content by weight) or drier humus soil 
(approximately 32% water content by weight), the larvae tended to 
pupate in the drier soil (78 vs. 0 adults in two replicas with the 
drier soil on the periphery (pc0.001). 
Underground, larvae constructed small, ovoid pupation cham- 
bers. The depth of 62 chambers in captivity averaged 1.7k1.2 cm. 
The long axis of 56 of 59 chambers was more nearly vertical than 
horizontal. The chambers were closed on all sides, and the inner 
walls were relatively smooth, perhaps due to addition of a secre- 
tion as in Altica spp. (Woods 19 17, 19 18). The length of 1 1 cham- 
bers (average 1.05k0.10 cm) was substantially greater than that of 
the pupae in these chambers (average 0.68L0.02 cm). 
Of 59 pupae of M. j., 56 faced more nearly upward than hori- 
zontal, 3 were more nearly horizontal than upward or downward, 
and 0 were more nearly downward. As in Altica spp. (Woods 19 17, 
1918, Barstow and Gittins 1973), pupae were covered with stiff 
bristles, presumably to keep the body out of contact with the walls 
of the chamber. The especially large bristles at the tip of the 
abdomen might seem designed to support the pupa's weight, but 
similar enlarged bristles occur in Altica bimarginata, which lies on 
its dorsum as a pupa (Woods 1917). 
Young pupae were orange with black setae, while the legs and 
heads of M. j. pupae about to moult to adults were blue, and the 
abdomen was swollen and extended directly rearward instead of 
curling ventrally. The pupal cuticle ripped near the anterior end, 
and the adult pulled its antennae and legs free as movements of the 
abdomen pulled the cuticle posteriorly. After freeing itself from 
the cuticle, the adult beetle extended its hind wings, projecting 
them posteriorly and ventrally from under the clear elytra. Individ- 
uals in captivity (on moist paper towels) braced their middle and 
hind legs laterally during this stage. Presumably beetles in pupal 
chambers braced themselves in the upper end of the chamber, thus 
giving the hind wings room to expand in the lower portion of the 
chamber. This would explain why pupation chambers were longer 
than the pupae. Young adults remained underground at least briefly 
before emerging on the surface. Sex ratios were close to 50:50. 




================================================================================


19931 Eberhard, Achoy, Marin & Ugalde 101 
48% of 914 M. sp. and 42% of 488 M. j. raised to adults were 
males. 
Males did not emerge before females, as in some other 
chrysomelids (Waloff and Richards 1958). Adult females may 
emerge from pupation with more reserves than males. Thus of 27 
survivors of a group of 88 adult M. j. which emerged in a container 
with moist earth and were kept with no food for about 7 days, 3 
were males and 24 females (p<0.001 compared with overall sex 
ratio). 
Host Plants 
As in many other alticines (Jolivet 1988), both species were 
oligophagous. They fed on different but overlapping sets of host 
plants. Adult and larval M. sp. occurred on Gunnera insignis (Gun- 
neraceae) (approximately 50-150 aggregations of adults seen, 
totalling probably 10-25,000 beetles near Rio Hondura, Zurqui, 
Cerro de la Muerte, Tapanti, and about 40 km NNW of San Jose on 
the road to Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui), but M. j. was never seen on 
this plant. On the other hand M. j. but not M. sp. adults were com- 
mon on Ludwigia hexapetala (Hook and Arn.) (Onagraceae) (more 
than 30 aggregations totalling probably >10,000 beetles seen at 
Rio Reventado, and Rio Barquero near Cartago). Adults and larvae 
of both species occurred at least occasionally on L. octovalvis 
(Jacq.) (estimated 100-200 aggregations of adults) and L. peru- 
viana (L.) (estimated 10-20 aggregations of adults) in and near the 
Universidad de Costa Rica in San Pedro de Montes de Oca, San 
Antonio de Escazu, Escazu, San Isidro de Heredia, and Cartago; 
M. j. was consistently more common than M. sp. on L. octovalvis 
(Table 2). Both species were also found on Cuphea sp. plants 
(Litraceae), but in monospecific aggregations (M. j. on C. calo- 
phylla Cham. and Schlechtd near Alajuelita about 5 KM E of 
Escazu, and on C. sp. near San Vito de Java, San Antonio de 
Escazu, and the Universidad de Costa Rica; M. sp. on C. sp. in 
Zurqui). Scattered adults of M. sp. were seen feeding on Tabachina 
longifolia (Melostomataceae) adjacent to large aggregations on G. 
insignis near Zurqui, and near San Antonio de Escazu. 
The four families of host plant are not closely related, but all are 
early secondary, weedy species. Ludwigia and Cuphea grow in 
humid soil, often with slowly moving or standing water, and are

common in roadside ditches carrying effluents from houses in sub- 
urban and rural situations. Gunnera and Tabachina differ in being 
associated with well drained soils rather than swampy substrates, 
but grow in recently disturbed areas; Gunnera is associated with 
very high rainfall (Fernandez 1984). 
Individual beetles can and probably sometimes do eat more than 
one food plant in nature. In one case, M. j. larvae (identified by 
association with mono-specific aggregation of adults) occurred in 
large numbers on plants of L. octovalvis which were nearly 
stripped of leaves, and in lower numbers on immediately adjacent 
Cuphea calophylla plants. In another case, a large aggregation of 
adult M. j. which was checked for several days first decimated a 
long row of L. octovalvis plants, then moved onto (and killed) sev- 
eral small Cuphea sp. plants before disbanding. Adults and larvae 
of M. sp. collected on G. insignis fed readily on L. hexapetala and 
L. octovalvis in captivity. 




================================================================================


19931 Eberhard, Achoy, Marin & Ugalde 103 
The nearly complete absence of M. sp. on L. hexapetala (3 of 
5,000-10,000 beetles), and the complete absence of M. j. on G. 
insignis (0 of several 10's of thousands of beetles) is probably 
related to the relative inability of the larvae of these species to 
develop on these plants (Table 3). In contrast, Fl hybrid larvae 
matured successfully on both of these species (Table 3). It 
appeared that G. insignis was more "difficult" for both beetle 
species as well as for hybrid larvae, as larval weight at maturity 
was lower for all crosses, and development times were longer 
(Table 1, see also oviposition rates below). Lower larval weights 
did not, however, generally lead to higher pupal mortality, except 
in the extreme case of the few small M. j. raised on G. insignis 
(Table 3). 
Reproductive Behavior 
Females in captivity began to oviposit several days after emerg- 
ing above ground. Feeding on living rather than recently picked 
leaves, and in more humid conditions lowered the number of days 
between first copulation and first oviposition, and raised the rate of 
egg production during the first days of oviposition (Table 4). 
Oviposition rates in the field may be lower. Of ten field- 
captured female M. j. placed on L. octovalvis plants, only 50% 
oviposited during the first 24 hours; 30% took 48-72 hours to 
oviposit; and 20% had still not oviposited 17 days later. Data for 
12 M. sp. collected on L. octovalvis were 17% oviposited in the 
first 24 hours, 33% after 24-72 hours, and 50% after 3-7 days. The 
average numbers of eggs laid in these clutches were not high 
(17.2k17.0 for M. j., 10.8k8.7 for M. sp.; compare with Fig. 3).

Captive female M. sp. feeding on L. octovalvis laid many more 
eggs than those feeding on G. insignis. Average daily rates for the 
first 24 days of oviposition by 26 individuals on L. octovalvis was 
6.32 eggslfemalelday (ranges 3.7 to 9.0 for averages for different 
females); the corresponding numbers for 15 individuals on G. 
insignis was 1.32 (range 0.45-1.80) (p<0.01 with Mann Whitney U 
Test comparing averages for 11 females on L. octovalvis with those 
for 10 on G. insignis). 
Conditions early in adult life also affected male sexual behavior. 
Male M. j. separated from females and kept in two groups of 20-40 
in gallon jars within 1-2 days after emerging and fed fresh cuttings 
of L. octovalvis once every 1-2 days all failed to mount and court 
females when they were 1-2 weeks old. In contrast, 19 of 19 males 
caged individually in plastic bags on living plants from their first 
day above ground mounted and courted females, often very assidu- 
ously, at the same age. 
Both males and females mated repeatedly in captivity. Since 
females usually discard the spermatophores in which sperm is

transferred a few hours after copulation (Eberhard and Kariko in

which had been kept captive with a male had been inseminated by 
counting the numbers of spermatophores in her petri dish. Pairs of 
M. j. mated more often than did M. sp. pairs (Table 5). Interspe- 
cific crosses gave results typical of the males rather than females 
(Table 5), so the differences between species were apparently due 
to differences between males. 
Females probably mate with many different males in the field.

equal number of males were placed in a cloth cage on a L. octo- 
valvis plant and checked each evening (9-12 PM), the same male 
was riding the female in successive evenings in 16 cases, different 
males rode on successive evenings in 16 cases, a male was riding 
on one evening but the female was alone on the next in 16 cases, 
and a female was alone on one evening but paired on the next in 10 
cases. The longest certain pairing was 3 days (since marks were 
rapidly lost, some cases were uncertain). 
A single spermatophore represents only about 1% of the male's 
weight (Eberhard and Kariko in prep.), and spermatophores were 
apparently not especially costly for males. When males were kept 
without food they continued to produce substantial numbers of 
spermatophores. Fifteen male M. j. were kept in a separate cage for 
at least 14 days on a branch of a potted L. octovalvis. During this 
period each male participated in 0-8 matings, during which he 
spent 2-6 hours with a female in a petri dish with a moist paper 
towel, and was then returned to plant. Each male was then placed 
with a virgin, 7-21 day-old female in a petri dish with a moist

paper towel but without food for three days. The number of sper- 
matophores found at the end of the first day (av. = 2.9k0.9) did not 
differ significantly from that at the end of the second (av. = 
3.1k1.0). The number decreased slightly on the third day to an 
average of 2.4k0.7, which was similar to rates of spermatophore 
production when field-caught males were kept with females and 
fed freshly cut leaves (av. = 2.1k0.5 - Table 5) (p<0.024 compar- 
ing each male on second vs. third days of the experiment using the 
Mann Whitney U Test). 
Females apparently needed to mate repeatedly to sustain egg 
production. Female M. j. kept continuously with a male showed a 
slow, continuous decline in the rate of oviposition over a period of 
about 60 days (Fig. 3a). In contrast, when 12 M. j. females which 
had mated twice (on the seventh and eighth days after they 
emerged above ground) were caged on potted L. octovalvis plants 
without access to further males, they ceased to oviposit in about a 
third of this time (after 20 days), and then resumed oviposition 
when allowed to mate again by being caged for three days with a 
male (Fig. 3b). Each female probably mated at least 5-10 times 
each during the second mating period (see above). The egg produc- 
tion by nine females was higher during the first 21 days of this sec- 
ond oviposition period (av. = 369k104 eggslfemale) than in the 
first 21 days of the first oviposition period (av. = 246+103 
eggstfemale), despite the expectation that egg production would 
decrease with the female's age (Fig. 3a; see also Waloff and 
Richards 1958), (totals for 8 of the 9 females were greater in the 
second period - ~~0.045 with Signs Test). Reductions in egg pro- 
duction resulted from a combination of lower numbers of females 
ovipositing (Fig. 3c), and smaller clutches (Fig. 3d). The spermath- 
ecae of two isolated females which had ceased to oviposit had only 
small accumulations of sperm, in contrast to the thick helix of 
sperm seen in the spermathecae of females from the field (Eber- 
hard and Kariko in prep.), so lack of sperm may have been 
involved. 
Defensive Behavior 
Although adults of both species have enlarged hind femora, they 
differed from many other alticines in not making long jumps when 
disturbed (e.g. Furth 1988). Instead they only hopped or lurched 




================================================================================

forward when disturbed, allowing themselves to fall. They often 
seized a leaf or stem on the way down before reaching the ground. 
Larvae also reacted to disturbance by falling from the plant, and 
curled when they reached the substrate below. When held in the 
fingers, adults usually regurgitated a dark-colored fluid from the 
mouth and/or a clear liquid from the tip of the abdomen. 
Adult M. sp. were apparently distasteful to three species of 
lizard. Two Anolis bipuratus, three Sceloporus malachitious, and 
two Gerhonotus monticola were offered M. sp. beetles; in all cases 
the lizard seized the beetle in its mouth, then spit it out. 
Aggregations of Adults 
Adults of both species usually occurred in aggregations which 
ranged up to more than 5000 individuals on a single plant or sev- 
eral neighboring plants. Usually there were slightly more males 
than females in an aggregation: in nine aggregations of M. sp. of 
more than 20 beetles, the ratio of malelfemale averaged 1.13k0.18 
(total of 975 beetles, differ from 1:l p<0.01); in seven similar 
aggregations of M. j. the average ratio was 1.27k0.49 (total of 738 
beetles, differ from 1:l p<0.01). This bias was probably not due to 
the sex ratio at birth, which was slightly skewed toward females 
(above). In both species most aggregations contained both feeding 
and mating individuals (e.g. Fig. 2). A few aggregations had 
mainly reproductively inactive beetles, which fed little or not at 
all; these will be discussed separately. 
Feeding Aggregations 
In both species it was sometimes possible to "track" a feeding 
aggregation by locating heavily damaged leaves of G. insignis (M. 
sp) or a series of partially or completely stripped L. octovalvis 
plants along a ditch. Some trails of M. sp. damage included both 
adult damage (Fig. 2), and damage by larvae to nearby leaves. The 
longest such trails were >30 m in both species, and included up to 
10-20 different plants. 
At night the beetles in one mixed species feeding and mating 
aggregation (Aggregation I) were essentially motionless, appar- 
ently immobilized by low temperatures. Many were in pairs, with 
the male riding on the female's dorsum. In the morning most bee- 
tles remained tightly grouped until direct sunlight fell on them,

then began to walk about. As the day advanced, the beetles became 
more active, and the aggregation less concentrated. Many male- 
female pairs separated, and beetles groomed, walked back and 
forth on the plant, and walked or flew onto nearby plants. Individu- 
als of M. sp. moved away from the night-time cluster more slowly 
than those of M. j. For example, at 8:30 AM of the morning of 30 
June, 43% of the 74 more or less immobile beetles in the central 
cluster were M. sp; at 11 AM, 61% of the 36 remaining beetles were 
M. sp. (p<.05). 
As the day wore on, new clumps of beetles formed, some on 
food plants and others on other species; clumps were nearly always 
in shaded sites during the earlier part of the day. Some of these 
aggregations dissolved as the day passed, and eventually the bee- 
tles accumulated on the host plant where the group would pass the 
next night. If the previous evening's host plant had not been con- 
sumed, some beetles stayed there, and the aggregation often 
reformed there the next evening. Sometimes the aggregation split 
into subgroups on different host plants on one night, then rejoined 
in a single group later. 
The behavior of M. sp. aggregations on G. insignis leaves was 
different. There was usually little flight activity near aggregations 
even during the heat of the day. Judging by the freshness of dam- 
age to leaves, aggregations probably moved between plants much 
less often. The difference is presumably related to the much larger 
leaves of G. insignis (average >1 m in diameter), and perhaps to 
slower rates of feeding. These leaves (especially young ones) were 
occasionally completely stripped by adults, but more often the 
aggregation moved on before more than half of the leaf surface had 
been consumed (Fig. 2). 
Some feeding aggregations apparently consisted largely of 
newly emerged adults, presumably in the vicinity of their pupation 
sites. No aggregation of this sort was studied in detail, but some 
aggregations of both species had few pairs and contained predomi- 
nantly soft-bodied individuals (recent emergence from under 
ground was confirmed in one M. sp. aggregation by finding that the 
males' genitalia were light in color). Two aggregations of mainly 
soft-bodied M. j. were found at sites where L. octovalvis plants had 
been completely stripped several weeks previously (judged by 
freshness of plants).

Non-feeding Aggregations 
Each of 15 randomly selected M. j. females in Aggregation I1 
had very large fat bodies, but none had eggs more than 0.7 mm 
long (mature eggs are about 1.2 mm long). There was also a low 
frequency of pairs (males mounted on females) in this aggregation. 
Only 17% of 426 beetles were paired on the night the aggregation 
was collected, and approximate counts on 3 earlier nights gave 
even lower percentages; 43% of the 352 unpaired beetles in this 
aggregation were females. 
Aggregation I11 of M. sp. was probably also reproductively inac- 
tive. The beetles did not feed during the three days they were 
observed (they were on low grass in a pasture), and few if any 
pairs formed at night (the beetles were piled on each other in some 
portions of the aggregation, making it impossible to count pairs). 
Similar lack of ovarian development was seen in 10 randomly 
selected females of M. sp. collected 22 Feb. 1992 from Aggrega- 
tion IV, which was also on grass, with Tabachina plants <10 m 
away. This aggregation was near the top of a steep ridge on the 
side of a mountain (Pico Blanco) (the other non-feeding aggrega- 
tion (111) of M. sp. was also near the top of a ridge.). 
Aggregation IV was observed over a longer period of time than 
the others. When first discovered on low grass at the edge of a road 
(22 Feb. 1992) it consisted of an estimated total of 1,000-2,000 M. 
sp. in several tightly packed clumps. When next seen (1 8 March), 
about 30 m from the first site (presumably the same aggregation - 
beetles were not marked until 20 March), an estimated 
3,000-10,000 beetles were dispersed in herbacious growth along 
3-4 m on the other side of the road. Observations just before sun- 
set and two nights later showed that the beetles remained dis- 
persed. A total of 300 beetles were marked along about 2 m of the 
roadside on 20 March, and marked beetles were seen over the next 
75 days. Sightings of marked individuals occurred along approxi- 
mately 60 m of the roadbank. Estimated numbers of beetles ranged 
from 200-300 to several thousand (at last sighting on 3 June, there 
were an estimated 1,000-2,000 individuals). These estimated sizes 
of this aggregation are minima, as the thick vegetation and the pos- 
sibility that some beetles had moved away from the edge of the 
road meant many beetles could easily have been missed on any 
given visit. On the visit following marking (22 March), 9 of 300 
beetles counted had marks. Assuming complete mixing, no loss of

Ill 
marks, and no arrivals of unmarked beetles, this ratio gives an esti- 
mated total of approximately 10,000 beetles in the aggregation on 
20 March. Since marks are often lost (see below), this may be an 
overestimate, but direct estimates gave approximately the same 
size. 
Aggregation IV lasted at least 97 days. The beetles occurred on 
a variety of plant species, but were only occasionally seen feeding, 
on Tabachina longifolia. In none of the first 11 visits were any 
male-female pairs seen (through 23 April - each visit was during 
the daylight hours except on 20 March). The first pair was seen on 
26 April in a group of about 600 individuals. Pairs remained rare 
until 16 May (four more visits), when there were more than 10 
pairs in a group of 200-300 individuals, and on 21 May there were 
25 pairs in a group of 85 individuals. Pairs were again relatively 
rare (<lo pairs among about 1,000 beetles) on 28 May. 
Movements of Aggregations 
We were unable to understand how the beetles in aggregations 
(both feeding and non-feeding) coordinated their movements. 
Some beetles in Aggregations I and I11 walked from one aggrega- 
tion site to the next, but most flew. The majority of flights were <1 
m. In Aggregation 111 most flights were in the direction in which 
the mass of beetles was moving, but this was not true in Aggrega- 
tion I. Both males and females in Aggregation I also initiated 
apparent long distance dispersal flights, flying directly upwards 
and away until they were lost from sight at a distance of at least 7 
m. Both males and females occurred on the periphery of aggrega- 
tions which were on the move. A sample of the periphery of a very 
large (probably several thousand) feeding aggregation of M. sp. 
which was moving included 19 males and 29 females. A similar 
collection on the periphery of the non-feeding Aggregation I1 (of 
M. j.) yielded 13 females and 11 males. 
The distances between nightly aggregation sites were 1-2 m for 
Aggregations 1-111. Individual beetles probably travelled much 
longer distances. 
Behavior within a Feeding and Mating Aggregation 
There were small differences in the behavior of M. sp. and M. j. 
in Aggregation I. During nightly checks each beetle's position was 
classified as "central" (near or in the central mass of beetles where

beetles were literally piled on each other), or "peripheral." Both 
male and female M. sp. were more likely to be in the central group 
than were individuals of M. j.: 78% of 137 male sightings and 81% 
of 286 female sightings of M. sp. were in the central group; corre- 
sponding figures for M. j. were 58% of 487 and 52% of 2
